/**
 * THE REFERENCE SWEEP — piece F1, acceptance criterion 2, of
 * docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-14-retire-swiftui-design.md.
 *
 * app/ is the shipping SwiftUI Mac app and it is FROZEN, not deleted (see
 * app/README-FROZEN.md). One day piece F3 deletes it. The point of this
 * test is that when that day comes, the full blast radius is already
 * written down in tools/app-references.json — with, for each file, what
 * breaks — instead of being discovered one red CI job at a time.
 *
 * So this test answers two questions, and the first one is the hard one.
 *
 * ── WHAT COUNTS AS A REFERENCE ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The obvious sweep — grep the tree for the literal string `app/` — is
 * wrong in both directions, and both were measured in this tree before
 * this comment was written:
 *
 *   MISSES. .github/workflows/weekly-toolchain.yml is, in its entirety,
 *   `swift run -c release kit-check` on macos-15 with `working-directory:
 *   app`. There is no slash. A grep for `app/` does not see an entire
 *   macOS workflow that F3 must delete — and that workflow is absent from
 *   the design spec's own reference table for exactly this reason.
 *   Likewise `swift build`, `Screepub-macOS.dmg` and the bare
 *   `Export.swift`-style provenance comments in src/.
 *
 *   FALSE POSITIVES. .github/workflows/release.yml says `path: app` and
 *   `cd app` in its app-bundles and app-upload jobs — and that `app` is
 *   the TAURI bundle staging directory, nothing to do with this one.
 *   tests/release-artifacts.test.ts:379 asserts `/cd app/` against that
 *   same Tauri job. A sweep that flagged those would be telling the next
 *   person to delete working code, which is how a guard earns its own
 *   deletion.
 *
 * The definition used here is therefore NOT textual proximity to "app".
 * A reference is:
 *
 *   an occurrence, in a tracked file outside app/, of a token that names
 *   the SwiftUI app itself — its directory, a Swift source file, a Swift
 *   build command, or a release artifact that only it produces.
 *
 * which is the PATTERNS list below. `cd app` is deliberately NOT in it:
 * it cannot be told apart from the Tauri staging directory by pattern, and
 * a pattern that needs a human to adjudicate every hit is a checklist
 * wearing a test's clothes. The one real `cd app`-shaped reference,
 * `working-directory: app`, is anchored to end-of-line and matches only
 * the five Swift steps.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS NOT SWEPT, AND WHY ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Dated records. docs/superpowers/ (specs, plans, run logs), docs/adr/ and
 * docs/releases/ describe what was decided or shipped on a given date.
 * Deleting app/ does not make a 2026-08-04 plan wrong; rewriting one to
 * hide that the Mac app existed would be worse than a dangling path. Four
 * plans there edit app/Sources/KitCheck/main.swift BY LINE NUMBER, and the
 * spec is explicit that the sweep must exclude them "or it will fight them
 * forever".
 *
 * This test and tools/app-references.json are also excluded: they name
 * every token in the list by construction, so counting them measures the
 * sweep, not the tree. They are the last two files F3 removes.
 *
 * ── THE SHAPE OF THE PIN ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The FILE SET is exact — a file that starts referring to app/ without a
 * row fails, and so does a row whose file no longer refers to app/ at all
 * (a stale row is a lie about the blast radius). The PER-FILE COUNT is a
 * CEILING, matching tests/frozen-app.test.ts: references may fall freely,
 * because every one that falls is progress toward F3, but a file cannot
 * quietly grow new ones. Exact counts would fail on an unrelated copy edit
 * to README.md, and a guard that fails for reasons nobody cares about is a
 * guard that gets deleted.
 *
 * Would a plausible wrong implementation pass? The non-vacuity block below
 * is the answer: a scanner that matched nothing, a pattern list that had
 * quietly lost its teeth, or an inventory of empty annotations would all
 * satisfy set equality against themselves. So the anchors, the categories
 * and the prose are asserted independently.
