// The gate at step 3 of docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-20-swift-to-tauri-handover.md.
//
// Signing has NEVER executed. Those secrets only reach a tagged release and
// no tag has ever built a Tauri app, so every claim this repository makes
// about the macOS signature is read off tauri-bundler's source. Step 3 is
// where that stops being a reading and becomes a fact, and the plan is
// explicit that a green workflow is not the same fact as a signature that
// satisfies the requirement the frozen updater pins.
//
// Which is why the requirement is not retyped. The plan's own shorthand,
//
//   =anchor apple generic and certificate leaf[subject.OU] = "XSRB3D643J"
//
// is WEAKER than what UpdateInstall.swift actually pins: it drops both
// Developer ID certificate-chain checks, and for the app it drops the
// bundle identifier. A DMG could satisfy the shorthand and be refused by
// the real installer, which is the exact failure step 3 exists to catch.
// So the strings live in one place, and the first test below is what keeps
// that place honest against the Swift the frozen app will actually run.
