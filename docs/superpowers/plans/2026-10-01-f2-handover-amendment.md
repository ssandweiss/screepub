# Plan amendment: the identifier release (F2) and the deletion (F3), re-mapped after 0.7.4

Date: 2026-10-01. Amends
[the handover plan](2026-09-20-swift-to-tauri-handover.md) (its steps 6 to 13,
written as "v0.6.1") and
[the retirement spec](../specs/2026-09-14-retire-swiftui-design.md) (F2, F3).
Decision record: [ADR 2026-09-20](../../adr/2026-09-20-swift-app-migrates-itself.md).

The handover plan was written before the window had an updater (0.7.1), app
settings (piece C), or a second release channel of its own. Its steps are
still right; three things around them changed, and one of them is a whole
population of users the ADR does not mention. This file records what was
measured on 2026-10-01 against main at `7eb40e5` (v0.7.4), what that changes,
and the order of work. Nothing here has been built yet.

## What was measured

1. **v0.7.4 publishes TWO `.dmg` assets**: `Screepub-macOS.dmg` (the Swift
   app, from `app/release.sh`) and `Screepub-Desktop-macOS-universal.dmg`
   (the window). `gh release view v0.7.4` lists both. The frozen Swift
   updater takes the first `.dmg` in GitHub's name-ordered asset list
   (`UpdateCheck.swift`; ordering measured 2026-09-21, see the spec), so F2
   must publish exactly one. ADR consequence 1 already says this; restated
   because both names are still live.
2. **The Swift updater takes the first `.app` inside the mounted image**
   (`UpdateInstall.appInside`: `items.first { $0.pathExtension == "app" }`),
   verifies it against the pinned requirement including the identifier, and
   swaps it into the RUNNING bundle's path. The name of the `.app` inside
   the DMG does not matter to it; the DMG's own `Applications` symlink has
   no extension and is skipped.
3. **The window's own updater never looks at the identifier.**
   `tauri-plugin-updater` 2.12.0, `updater.rs` lines 1294 to 1388 (macOS
   `install_inner`): it unpacks the archive, dropping the top-level
   directory name (`.skip(1)`), renames the running bundle aside and
   renames the new contents into `extract_path`, which is the running
   bundle's path. Read in `~/.cargo/registry/src/.../tauri-plugin-updater-2.12.0`.
4. **The window keeps four values in WebKit `localStorage`**
   (`desktop/ui/update.js`: `STAMP`, `OPT_IN`, `ASKED`, `FOUND`): when it
   last checked, whether the person opted in to automatic checks, whether
   the one-time question was asked, and the version it last found. WebKit
   keys that storage by bundle identifier
   (`~/Library/WebKit/<identifier>/`). Everything else the window and
   engine keep lives in the engine's settings file and the library
   (`~/Library/Application Support/Screepub`, `~/Documents/Screepub`),
   which no identifier touches.
5. **The `release` job is three jobs wearing one name.** It builds and
   notarizes the Swift app, it builds, signs and notarizes the two macOS CLI
   tarballs the Homebrew FORMULA serves (`app/release.sh` lines 45 to 78 and
   112 to 117), and it creates the GitHub Release itself (draft, upload,
   publish). `cross-upload`, `app-upload` and `tap` all `needs: release`.
   `tools/build-cli.ts` says outright that it never makes a macOS artifact.
   So "take `app/release.sh` out of `release.yml`" (handover step 8) is not
   a deletion: the CLI build and the release creation need a new home
   first.
6. **The tap's scripts name `Screepub-macOS.dmg` and nothing else.**
   `tools/bump-tap.sh` (digest, cask stanza), `tools/check-tap.sh`
   (`check_sha "Screepub-macOS.dmg"`), and the crib sheet in `release.yml`.

## The population the ADR does not cover: people already running the window

ADR 2026-09-20 covers Swift installs (`com.darkwell.screepub`) upgrading to
the window. Since 0.7.1 there is a second group: people running the window
itself, installed as `Screepub Desktop.app` with identifier
`com.darkwell.screepub.desktop`, updating through `latest.json`.

At F2, `latest.json` carries them to the new identifier automatically (3).
`latest.json` is keyed by platform, not identifier, so there is no way to
publish an update for one group and not the other; "have them re-download
instead" is not actually available unless the release also stops publishing
`latest.json`, which would strand them on a 404. What they get instead is
four one-time costs, all measured or read rather than guessed:

- **The update question comes back once.** (4) The opt-in answer and the
  "asked" flag are in identifier-keyed storage. Someone who had opted in is
  opted out until they answer again.
- **macOS asks again for removable-volume access** the first time the new
  identity copies to a Kindle. TCC grants are keyed to the signing identity.
  (Swift installs probably keep theirs: same team, same identifier, so the
  same designated requirement. Not verified.)
- **The bundle keeps its file name**, `Screepub Desktop.app`, because the
  updater replaces in place (3). The menu bar says "Screepub"; Finder and
  the Dock say "Screepub Desktop".
- **Anyone with BOTH apps ends up with two copies of the same app**, one
  named `Screepub.app` (the Swift install, swapped by its updater) and one
  named `Screepub Desktop.app`, both `com.darkwell.screepub`. The owner is in
  this group: checked 2026-10-01, `/Applications/Screepub.app` is the Swift
  app at 0.7.3 and `/Applications/Screepub Desktop.app` is the window at
  0.7.2.

Making it fully seamless would mean moving the four update values into the
engine's settings file in a release BEFORE F2 (so they survive), and having
something rename the bundle after the swap. The first is a modest window
change; the second is logic in the shell or a self-rename from the engine,
against `desktop/README.md`'s rule and fragile when `Screepub.app` already
exists. **Recommendation: accept the four costs and name them in the F2
release notes**, with one line telling people who had both apps to delete
`Screepub Desktop`. This is the owner's call (queued below).

## Decisions queued for the owner

1. **Window users: accept the four one-time costs?** (Recommended: yes.)
2. **The single Mac download's name.** Recommended: `Screepub-macOS.dmg`.
   It is the URL the site buttons, the README, the cask and every external
   link point at today; naming the window's image that way means
   they all start serving the window with no edit, and `bump-tap.sh` and
   `check-tap.sh` keep working unchanged (6). The cost: links to
   `Screepub-Desktop-macOS-universal.dmg` 404 from F2 on. The alternative
   keeps the Desktop name and edits every Swift-name reference instead.
   **2b, only if 2 is yes:** the spec settled "retire the cask at F2". With
   the name kept, the cask needs no change to serve the window: `app
   "Screepub.app"` matches once the transition overlay is gone. Keep the
   cask after all, or retire it as decided?
3. **The F3 wait.** The spec says F3 runs "one release cycle after F2". With
   the CLI move below there are naturally two releases after F2 anyway.
   Keep the wait? (Recommended: yes; it is free.)
4. **Version and go-ahead** for each release: asked at the time, in the
   owner's own chat, never relayed.

## Status, 2026-10-01 evening

The owner answered every decision below: accept the four window-user
costs; the image is `Screepub-macOS.dmg`; the cask is RETIRED (his direct
choice, over "keep"); keep the F3 wait. Built, none of it pushed:

- **F2** on `worktree-f2-identifier`: identity, image name, one `.dmg`,
  cask retirement in the tap scripts, the QA section. The other session's
  `f2-docs` branch sits on top with the README, site and doc lines.
- **The CLI move** on `cli-move`, stacked on F2.
- **F3** not started: it waits for the other session's second batch
  (which edits retired-coverage, app-references and weekly-toolchain) to
  land, to avoid rebasing a 66-file sweep across it.

## Order of work

Four releases from here, each changing one kind of thing, because each is
only provable at a tag.

| Release | Carries | Why separate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| N (next) | the housekeeping batch (other session) | already in flight |
| N+1 | **F2: identity only** | the handover plan's own rule: "Do not bundle other changes into" it |
| N+2 | **the macOS CLI build moves out of `app/release.sh`**; the Swift job leaves `release.yml` | changes how the formula's binaries are signed, provable only at a tag, and `app/` is still there to fall back on |
| N+3 | **F3: `git rm -r app/`** and the reference sweep to empty | the last step, one release after F2 at the earliest |

N+2 and N+3 can merge into one release if the owner prefers fewer, at the
cost of losing the fallback for a broken CLI signing path.

## F2 (release N+1): steps, re-mapped onto today's files

Branch `worktree-f2-identifier`, rebased onto main after the batch lands
(the batch's window helper also edits `tauri.conf.json` and
`tests/desktop-shell.test.ts`).

1. **Identifier.** `desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`:
   `com.darkwell.screepub.desktop` to `com.darkwell.screepub`.
2. **Invert the tripwire.** `tests/desktop-shell.test.ts`'s identifier test
   asserts `.desktop` and NOT the Swift id. Invert it deliberately, comment
   rewritten to say the apps now share an identity on purpose.
3. **Drop the transition overlay.** Delete
   `desktop/src-tauri/tauri.transition.conf.json`; remove `--config
   tauri.transition.conf.json` from `release.yml`'s universal row; update
   the pins (`git grep` for `transition.conf` and `Screepub Desktop` found
   about 20 files on 2026-10-01, most of them tests:
   `build-app-bundle`, `release-app-step`, `verify-signing`,
   `build-update-manifest`, `check-latest`, `update-signature`,
   `smoke-bundle`, `desktop-shell`).
4. **Name the image** per decision 2: `tools/build-app-bundle.ts`'s DMG row
   `releasedName`, and the updater archive's row to match
   (`Screepub-macOS-universal.app.tar.gz`), with the parsers in
   `tools/build-update-manifest.ts` and `tools/check-latest.ts` that match
   archive names by regex.
5. **Publish one `.dmg`.** `release.yml`'s `release` job stops uploading
   `app/dist/Screepub-macOS.dmg` and stops hashing it into the notes; the
   job KEEPS running `app/release.sh` for the CLI tarballs until N+2. The
   install line in the notes and the crib sheet name the window's image.
   `app-upload`'s count stays at one `.dmg`; add a check that the release
   as a whole holds exactly one `.dmg` (the Swift job no longer adds one,
   and nothing should ever again).
6. **Signing check.** `tools/verify-signing.ts --expect handover` already
   exists and asserts the Swift updater would INSTALL the image. Run it on
   the downloaded DMG after the tag, as v0.6.0 ran `--expect coexist`.
7. **Release notes disclosures** (`docs/releases/<N+1>.md`): Cancel during
   conversion is gone; Swift-app tuning is lost once (books untouched);
   the four window-user costs above, plus "if you had both apps, delete
   Screepub Desktop".
8. **`docs/mac-qa.md` §4 and §5** become "one app replaces the other": a
   Swift install updates into the window; a window install updates and
   keeps its name.
9. **The README and the site** change only where they name the Desktop
   image (and not at all for the buttons, if decision 2 is yes). The other
   session owns both; message it with the final names.
10. **The tap** per decision 2b. If the cask is retired: deprecate it in
    `homebrew-tap/` (a separate repo, hidden from `git status`), retire the
    cask half of `tap-freshness.yml` and `check-tap.sh`, drop the cask digest
    from `bump-tap.sh`, and verify against the PUBLISHED tap.
11. **The owner's hands, after the tag**: his Swift install updates itself
    into the window and relaunches; his window install updates and asks
    the update question once. This is handover step 13 and the only test
    that matters.

## Found while building F2 (2026-10-01, later)

Steps 1 to 3 are built (commit "F2: the window takes the Swift app's
identity"). Steps 4 and 5 wait on decisions 2 and 2b, because they decide
what the README, site and verification ledger must say, and those are the
other session's files. Three things the steps above did not know:

- **The tap job would race the image.** `tap` is `needs: release`, and
  `tools/bump-tap.sh` reads `Screepub-macOS.dmg`'s digest off the
  published release. Today the release job uploads that image itself. After
  F2 the image comes from `app-upload`, which runs later, so a kept cask
  needs `tap` to wait on `app-upload` too, or `bump-tap.sh` finds no image
  and the tap goes red. A retired cask makes this moot.
- **Swift users can be told "no update" for a day.** The release job makes
  the release public before `app-upload` attaches the image. A Swift app
  that checks in that gap finds no `.dmg`, throws, and has already stamped
  its last-check time (the release job's own comment describes this), so
  it waits 24 hours. Accepted rather than fixed: making `app-upload`
  publish would break the rule that a failing bundle leg can never strand
  the release in draft. It costs a day, once, for whoever is unlucky.
- **The window claims macOS 10.13 and cannot run below 13.0.** The
  installed window's `LSMinimumSystemVersion` is `10.13` (Tauri's default),
  but its engine's `LC_BUILD_VERSION` says `minos 13.0` (bun's floor;
  measured with `otool -l` on `Screepub Desktop.app`). On macOS 11 or 12
  the window opens and every conversion fails. The fix is
  `bundle.macOS.minimumSystemVersion: "13.0"`; it is independent of F2 and
  goes on its own branch. The release notes' "macOS 14+" line was the
  Swift app's floor and should say 13 once the window is the download.

## The CLI move (release N+2)

The two macOS CLI tarballs need a builder that does not live in `app/`. The
shape that fits the repo: extend `tools/build-cli.ts` with `macos-arm64` and
`macos-x64` targets for packaging and verification (it already detects
Mach-O), and do the signing and notarization in a `release.yml` step on the
macOS runner, the way `app/release.sh` does now (codesign with hardened
runtime and timestamp, `notarytool` on a zip, no staple for a bare
Mach-O). The `release` job then imports the certificate, builds the CLI,
creates the release and uploads; the Swift build, Rosetta and
`app/release.sh` leave the workflow. `tests/release-app-step.test.ts` and
the build-cli tests follow. The formula's URLs and names do not change.

The CLI is signed today with `app/screepub-engine.entitlements` (allow-jit,
allow-unsigned-executable-memory, disable-library-validation), so that file
moves out of `app/` with the build. Observed 2026-10-01: the window's
shipped engine (`Screepub Desktop.app/Contents/MacOS/screepub-engine`) is
signed with the hardened runtime and NO entitlements, and converts fine, so
they may not be needed. Keep them anyway: the move should change where the
CLI is built, not how it is signed.

## F3 (release N+3): the deletion

Acceptance criteria 11 to 15 of the spec, re-checked against today:

- **11, coverage and the sweep.** `docs/retired-coverage.md`'s Built column
  is stale: `send-menu`, `mail-and-books` and `feedback-url` were built by
  parity pieces B and C (2026-09-24) and still read "no". Update it with
  the test that now covers each, then shrink `tools/app-references.json` to
  empty. `tests/frozen-app.test.ts` and `tools/frozen-app-manifest.json`
  (the F1 freeze guard) go with `app/`.
- **12, brand tokens.** Done early (`brand/tokens.json`, 2026-09-23).
- **13, the KFX plugin.** Answered by piece D: `replaced`, the engine
  installs through Calibre's own index. Check `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` no
  longer describes a vendored zip.
- **14, `CLAUDE.md`'s `format-defaults.json` invariant** loses kit-check
  and names the pins that remain.
- **15, one reviewable commit.** `git rm -r app/`; `ci.yml`'s `app` job
  goes, and so does `weekly-toolchain.yml`'s Swift job; no workflow
  references a Swift job. Suite green. (`weekly-toolchain.yml` was
  Swift-only on 2026-10-01, but the other session's second batch adds a
  weekly Calibre job to it, so F3 removes the Swift job, not the file.)

The F3 branch can be prepared any time and held; it merges only after
N+1 has shipped and N+2 has proven the CLI move.

**The per-file list already exists**: `tools/app-references.json` (66 rows,
425 references on 2026-10-01 after the batch), each with a "breaks" note
saying what it is. F3 drives every row to zero and deletes the file's rows
as it goes. Most are provenance comments (`note`) and doc lines. The ones
that need thought, from those notes:

- `tests/theme-colors.ts` opens `Theme.swift` for its CONTENT, and
  `tests/brand-tokens.test.ts` imports it. The comparison is already
  `skipIf` the Swift file is missing; the parser and helpers it shares must
  stay or move, not vanish.
- `tests/verify-signing.test.ts` pins `tools/verify-signing.ts`'s
  requirement strings clause by clause against `UpdateInstall.swift`. After
  F3 the strings have no upstream: they become this repository's own
  definition, with the Swift quoted in a comment as history. Keep the tool:
  installed Swift apps in the wild still demand exactly those strings.
- `tests/update-compare.test.ts` mirrors kit-check lines 774 to 812 pair
  for pair. The assertions stay; the "mirror" framing becomes a comment.
- `tests/release-artifacts.test.ts` READS `app/release.sh` (about eight
  tests). Most of them change at N+2 with the CLI move, not at F3.
- `tap-freshness.yml` has no textual reference and is invisible to the
  sweep (its row is `tools/check-tap.sh`): re-check it by hand.
- `retired-coverage.md` (55 references) is the gate-2 record. Every `port`
  row is built as of 2026-10-01 (the last, `update-error-descriptions`, was
  re-audited that day). It stays as history with its app/ paths, which means
  the sweep must learn to exclude it, the way it excludes docs/superpowers/;
  or it moves under docs/superpowers/. Owner's choice, small.
- `tests/app-references.test.ts` itself: criterion 11 says the inventory is
  EMPTY when F3 is done. The test then has nothing to pin and should go
  with the directory, or stay as a guard that `app/` never comes back.
