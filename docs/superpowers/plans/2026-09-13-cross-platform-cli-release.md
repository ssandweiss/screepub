# Cross-Platform CLI Release Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Ship the command-line converter to Linux and Windows, as release artifacts built beside the existing macOS ones and never in place of them. Bun cross-compiles every target from one machine, so this is an **additive** change: three new artifacts, one new build tool, one new smoke tool, four new workflow jobs. The macOS binaries, the DMG, the Homebrew tap and everything under `app/` are untouched.

**Architecture:** Two Bun/TypeScript tools carry all the logic, and the YAML only calls them. `tools/build-cli.ts` holds the target table, the cross-compile, the packaging (tar.gz via system `tar`, zip via the already-vendored `jszip`), a **byte-level binary-format check** that reads ELF/PE/Mach-O magic rather than shelling out to `file`, the artifact verification, and `SHA256SUMS`. `tools/smoke-cli.ts` holds what a per-OS job must prove about a binary it just downloaded — `--version` agrees with `package.json`, the committed fixture converts to a real EPUB, and `devices --json` starts. Both split into small pure functions with injected seams (a `Spawn`, a `Runner`, a `Floors` record), so every branch is a cheap unit test and the two slow things — a real cross-compile and a real conversion — are exercised once, in one end-to-end test. Workflow YAML is asserted against by parsing it with `Bun.YAML.parse` and checking the **job graph**, not by grepping prose.

**Tech Stack:** TypeScript, Bun (`bun:test`, `Bun.spawnSync`, `Bun.gunzipSync`, `Bun.YAML`), Node built-ins (`node:fs`, `node:path`, `node:crypto`, `node:util`'s `parseArgs`), `jszip` (already a dependency), system `tar`. No new dependencies.

**Spec:** [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-13-cross-platform-cli-release-design.md`](../specs/2026-09-13-cross-platform-cli-release-design.md)
**Program ADR:** [`docs/adr/2026-09-12-cross-platform-tauri.md`](../../adr/2026-09-12-cross-platform-tauri.md)
**Follows:** [piece B — CLI device commands](2026-09-13-cli-device-commands.md)

## Global Constraints

- **The macOS release path is untouchable.** `app/release.sh` signs and notarizes the macOS CLI binaries and `tools/bump-tap.sh` hardcodes their filenames. Do not move, rename, rebuild or re-package them, and do not add a macOS target to the new builder. Verified two ways: permanent tests on the artifact names (Task 12), and a byte-for-byte digest check in Final Verification.
- **No file under `app/` may be modified.** Verify with `git status --short app/` before every commit; it must print nothing.
- **No file under `tools/bump-tap.sh` or `tools/check-tap.sh` may be modified.** Same check, same reason: the tap has its own freshness alarm and no test here can catch a tap that stops installing.
- **Nothing asserts a property a plausible wrong implementation could still satisfy.** In particular: a test that a build produced a file is worthless, because a 0-byte file or an x86-64 binary named `linux-arm64` would pass it. Every artifact assertion checks the **format magic bytes**, a **non-trivial size floor**, and — for archives — that the member is present under the right name, at the right size, in the right format, with its executable bit set.
- **No test commits or leaves a build artifact in the repo.** Artifacts are 39–119 MB each. Every test builds into `mkdtempSync(join(tmpdir(), …))` and removes it in `afterAll`. `--out` on `build-cli.ts` is **required with no default**, so nothing can write 250 MB somewhere nobody asked for. `.gitignore` coverage of `dist/` and `build/` is pinned by a test (Task 9) for the hand-run case.
- **`tests/fixture-stability.test.ts` and `tests/fixtures/` are not touched.** The committed fixtures keep reproducing byte-for-byte; `screenplay.pdf` is read by the smoke path and never rewritten.
- **No conversion changes of any kind.** The parser, the renderers, `convert.ts`, `options.ts` and `src/epub/css.ts` are untouched. Nothing here is a formatting behavior, so `docs/formatting-options-log.md` is not updated.
- **`package.json`'s version is NOT bumped by this piece.** `screepub --version` reports `package.json` inlined at compile time, so `build-cli.ts` *verifies* the two agree and refuses to build when they don't — but choosing when 0.6.0 ships is the release's job, not this piece's.
- **Release notes must never contain a checksum or the word for one.** `release.yml`'s `checks` job greps the notes for `sha-?256` and 64-hex runs and fails the tag. Task 15 adds that rule to the in-suite banned list so it fails in nine seconds instead of after notarization.
- **`tsconfig.json` includes only `src` and `tests`.** The new tools are typechecked because the tests import them; that is deliberate and no tsconfig change is needed. `verbatimModuleSyntax` is on, so type-only imports must be spelled `import type`.
- **Existing suite stays green:** 799 tests pass (3 skipped) and `bunx tsc --noEmit` is clean after every task.

## What rides untested until the next tag

Stated plainly, because the spec asks for it and because the honest list is short:

- The **release.yml job graph** itself — that `cross-cli` runs after `checks`, that the two smoke jobs find the uploaded artifact, that `cross-upload` attaches four assets to an already-published release. Task 14's tests parse the YAML and assert the graph, which catches a typo'd `needs:` or a renamed asset, but nothing local can prove GitHub schedules it.
- **`actions/upload-artifact` / `actions/download-artifact`** round-tripping 250 MB.
- **`gh release upload` against a published release**, including `GH_REPO` standing in for a checkout.
- **`Expand-Archive` on windows-latest**, and the Windows runner's `bun` invoking `tools/smoke-cli.ts`.
- **The Windows binary ever executing.** Nothing on this project has a Windows machine. The release run's smoke job is the first execution that will ever happen, which is exactly why it exists and why it gates `cross-upload`.
- **linux-arm64 is built but never smoke-tested** in CI: no arm64 runner is assumed available. It is the maintainer's own daily architecture and Task 11 runs it for real on this machine when the host is arm64 Linux, but that is a developer machine, not the release. The notes say so.

## File Structure

**Created:**

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `tools/build-cli.ts` | The build matrix. Target table, cross-compile, packaging, binary-format detection, artifact verification, `SHA256SUMS`. Runnable by hand. |
| `tools/smoke-cli.ts` | What a per-OS job proves about a downloaded binary: version, a real conversion, `devices --json`. Dependency-free so a bare Windows runner can run it. |
| `tests/build-cli.test.ts` | Unit tests for every function in `build-cli.ts`, with crafted bytes and injected seams. |
| `tests/build-cli-e2e.test.ts` | One real cross-compile of two targets, packaged and verified with the production floors, smoke-run when the host can execute one of them. |
| `tests/smoke-cli.test.ts` | The smoke assertions against canned CLI output — the pass case and every failure mode. |
| `tests/release-artifacts.test.ts` | The release machinery's invariants: macOS artifact names, the tap script's hardcoded names, the workflow job graph, SHA-pinned actions. |
| `docs/releases/0.6.0.md` | Reader-facing notes carrying the two honesty statements. |

**Modified:**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | A `cross-cli` job: build all three targets on every push, and run the linux-x64 one. |
| `.github/workflows/release.yml` | Four jobs added — `cross-cli`, `smoke-linux-x64`, `smoke-windows-x64`, `cross-upload`. The `checks`, `release`, `tap` and `tap-check` jobs are not edited. |
| `README.md` | Linux and Windows install, the unsigned-Windows warning, the unproven-hardware caveat. |
| `tests/release-notes.test.ts` | `sha256` and `sha-256` join the banned-term list. |

**Untouched, and verified so:** everything under `app/`, `tools/bump-tap.sh`, `tools/check-tap.sh`, `.github/workflows/tap-freshness.yml`, `tests/fixture-stability.test.ts`, `tests/fixtures/`.

### Task 1: Binary format from the magic bytes

The whole piece rests on this. Everything downstream ("the artifact is a genuine aarch64 ELF") is only as strong as the function that decides it, and the obvious alternative — shelling out to `file` — is not available on a Windows runner, is not guaranteed in a bare container, and returns prose. Reading the header is four lines per format and exact.

The offsets below were confirmed against real `bun build --compile` output for all four targets: ELF `e_machine` at `0x12` is `0x3e` (x86-64) and `0xb7` (aarch64); the Windows build is `MZ` with its PE header at `0x78` and machine `0x8664`; the darwin build is `cf fa ed fe` with cputype `0x0100000c`. Mach-O is recognised even though nothing here builds it, because Task 12 asserts the builder never *emits* one and a detector that could not name it would make that assertion vacuous.

**Files:**
- Create: `tools/build-cli.ts`
- Test: `tests/build-cli.test.ts` (create)

**Interfaces:**
- Produces:
  ```ts
  export type BinaryFormat =

### Task 2: The target table, and the paths around it

One table is the whole build matrix. It carries, per target, the `bun build --target=` name, the format its output must have, how it is packaged, what the binary is called inside the archive, and what the archive is called on the release page.

Two path facts have to be encoded rather than remembered. First, **`bun build --compile` appends `.exe` itself** for the Windows target: the outfile it is *given* must not carry the extension, and the file it *produces* does. Second, all three targets would otherwise compile to the same filename, so each gets its own build directory while the archives land flat in the output directory — which is what keeps `SHA256SUMS` free of path components.

**Files:**
- Modify: `tools/build-cli.ts`
- Test: `tests/build-cli.test.ts` (append)

**Interfaces:**
- Produces:
  ```ts
  export type TargetId = 'linux-x64' | 'linux-arm64' | 'windows-x64';
  export interface Target {
    id: TargetId;
    bunTarget: string;        // 'bun-linux-x64'
    format: BinaryFormat;     // what its output must be
    packaging: 'tar.gz' | 'zip';
    binaryName: string;       // 'screepub' | 'screepub.exe'
    archiveName: string;      // 'screepub-cli-linux-x64.tar.gz'
  }
  export const TARGETS: readonly Target[];
  export function buildDir(target: Target, outDir: string): string;
  export function compileOutfile(target: Target, outDir: string): string;
  export function binaryPath(target: Target, outDir: string): string;
  export function archivePath(target: Target, outDir: string): string;
  export function targetIdForHost(platform: string, arch: string): TargetId | undefined;

### Task 3: Arguments, and the version the binary will actually report

`--out` has no default. A default would let a mistyped command write 250 MB into the repo, and the first symptom would be a `git status` nobody reads.

`--version` is not injected into anything: `screepub --version` reports `package.json`'s version, inlined at compile time. So the flag's real job is to be *checked* against `package.json` — the same guard `app/release.sh` already applies on the macOS side, for the same reason. A binary that disagrees with its tag lies about itself in every bug report.

**Files:**
- Modify: `tools/build-cli.ts`
- Test: `tests/build-cli.test.ts` (append)

**Interfaces:**
- Produces:
  ```ts
  export interface BuildArgs { version: string; outDir: string; only: TargetId[] }
  export function parseBuildArgs(argv: string[]): BuildArgs;
  export function assertPackageVersion(version: string, repoDir?: string): void;
  ```

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Append to `tests/build-cli.test.ts`:

```ts
describe('parseBuildArgs', () => {
  test('takes a version and an output directory', () => {
    const args = parseBuildArgs(['--version', '0.6.0', '--out', '/tmp/x']);

    expect(args.only).toEqual(['linux-x64', 'linux-arm64', 'windows-x64']);
  });

  test('accepts a tag spelling and normalises it', () => {
    expect(parseBuildArgs(['--version', 'v0.6.0', '--out', '/tmp/x']).version).toBe('0.6.0');
    expect(parseBuildArgs(['--version', 'v0.6.0-rc1', '--out', '/tmp/x']).version).toBe('0.6.0-rc1');
  });

  test('refuses a version that is not MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH', () => {

  });

  test('resolves the output directory to an absolute path', () => {

      .toEqual(['linux-x64', 'windows-x64']);
    // A typo must stop the build, not quietly produce nothing — which is
    // what filtering an unknown id out of the matrix would do.
    expect(() => parseBuildArgs(['--version', '0.6.0', '--out', '/tmp/x', '--only', 'darwin-arm64']))
      .toThrow(/darwin-arm64/);
    expect(() => parseBuildArgs(['--version', '0.6.0', '--out', '/tmp/x', '--only', 'linux_x64']))
      .toThrow(/linux-x64, linux-arm64, windows-x64/);
  });

  test('rejects an unknown flag rather than ignoring it', () => {
    expect(() => parseBuildArgs(['--version', '0.6.0', '--out', '/tmp/x', '--sign'])).toThrow();

});

describe('assertPackageVersion', () => {
  function repoWith(version: unknown): string {

    writeFileSync(join(dir, 'package.json'), JSON.stringify({ name: 'screepub', version }));
    return dir;

  test('passes when package.json agrees with the requested version', () => {
    const dir = repoWith('0.6.0');
    try {
      expect(() => assertPackageVersion('0.6.0', dir)).not.toThrow();
    } finally {
      rmSync(dir, { recursive: true, force: true });
    }
  });

  test('refuses to build a binary that would misreport itself', () => {
    const dir = repoWith('0.5.4');
    try {
      // Both numbers in the message: the whole value of this guard is that
      // whoever hits it knows which one to change.
      expect(() => assertPackageVersion('0.6.0', dir)).toThrow(/0\.5\.4/);
      expect(() => assertPackageVersion('0.6.0', dir)).toThrow(/0\.6\.0/);
    } finally {
      rmSync(dir, { recursive: true, force: true });
    }
  });

  test('the real repo agrees with itself', () => {
    const pkg = JSON.parse(readFileSync('package.json', 'utf8')) as { version: string };
    expect(() => assertPackageVersion(pkg.version)).not.toThrow();

### Task 4: The cross-compile itself

The invocation is one line, and the risk is entirely in getting that line exactly right — a dropped `--target=` silently builds the host architecture, and a wrong entry point builds a working binary of the wrong program. So the argv is built by a pure function and asserted element by element, with the spawn injected so the argv test costs nothing.

**Files:**
- Modify: `tools/build-cli.ts`
- Test: `tests/build-cli.test.ts` (append)

**Interfaces:**
- Produces:
  ```ts
  export interface SpawnResult { exitCode: number; stderr: string }
  export type Spawn = (argv: string[], cwd: string) => SpawnResult;
  export function compileArgv(target: Target, outDir: string): string[];
  export function compileTarget(target: Target, outDir: string, spawn?: Spawn, repoDir?: string): string;
  ```

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Append to `tests/build-cli.test.ts`:

```ts
describe('compileArgv', () => {
  test('is the exact bun invocation, per target', () => {
    // Element-by-element. A dropped --target= silently builds the HOST
    // architecture and every later format check would then be comparing a
    // native binary against itself.
    expect(compileArgv(TARGETS[0]!, '/tmp/out')).toEqual([
      'bun', 'build', '--compile', '--target=bun-linux-x64',
      'src/cli.ts', '--outfile=/tmp/out/linux-x64/screepub',
    ]);
    expect(compileArgv(TARGETS[2]!, '/tmp/out')).toEqual([
      'bun', 'build', '--compile', '--target=bun-windows-x64',
      'src/cli.ts', '--outfile=/tmp/out/windows-x64/screepub',
    ]);
  });

  test('every target names its own bun target and nothing else', () => {
    for (const t of TARGETS) {
      const argv = compileArgv(t, '/tmp/out');
      expect(argv).toContain(`--target=${t.bunTarget}`);
      expect(argv.filter((a) => a.startsWith('--target=')).length).toBe(1);
      expect(argv).toContain('src/cli.ts');
      expect(argv.some((a) => a.endsWith('.exe'))).toBe(false);
    }
  });
});

describe('compileTarget', () => {
  test('runs bun from the repo root and returns the path bun WROTE', () => {
    const dir = mkdtempSync(join(tmpdir(), 'screepub-compile-'));
    try {

      const fake = (argv: string[], cwd: string) => {

      expect(seen.length).toBe(1);
      expect(seen[0]!.cwd).toBe('/repo');
      expect(seen[0]!.argv).toEqual(compileArgv(win, dir));
      // The returned path is where bun PUTS it, not what we asked for.
      expect(out).toBe(join(dir, 'windows-x64', 'screepub.exe'));
      expect(existsSync(join(dir, 'windows-x64'))).toBe(true); // dir made first
    } finally {
      rmSync(dir, { recursive: true, force: true });
    }
  });

  test('a failed compile throws, naming the target and bun stderr', () => {
    const dir = mkdtempSync(join(tmpdir(), 'screepub-compile-'));
    try {
      const fake = () => ({ exitCode: 1, stderr: 'error: unknown target\n' });
      expect(() => compileTarget(TARGETS[1]!, dir, fake, '/repo')).toThrow(/linux-arm64/);
      expect(() => compileTarget(TARGETS[1]!, dir, fake, '/repo')).toThrow(/unknown target/);
    } finally {
      rmSync(dir, { recursive: true, force: true });

```

Add `existsSync` to the `node:fs` import at the top of the test file.

Expected: FAIL — `compileArgv` is not exported.

  return { exitCode: proc.exitCode ?? 1, stderr: proc.stderr.toString() };
};

/** The one invocation, as data, so it can be asserted element by element

### Task 5: Reading an archive back

Verification has to see *inside* the archive, because that is where the two failures nobody notices live: a tarball that contains nothing, and a binary that lost its executable bit on the way in. Both look like a perfectly good 39 MB download.

Both readers are written here rather than shelled out to. `tar -tzvf` answers in a format that varies between GNU tar and bsdtar; the tar header is 512 fixed bytes and `Bun.gunzipSync` is already in the runtime. `jszip` is already a dependency and is the only thing here that can read back the permission bits it wrote.

**Files:**
- Modify: `tools/build-cli.ts`
- Test: `tests/build-cli.test.ts` (append)

**Interfaces:**
- Produces:
  ```ts
  export interface ArchiveEntry { name: string; size: number; mode: number; data: Uint8Array }

  export function zipEntries(archivePath: string): Promise<ArchiveEntry[]>;
  export function archiveEntries(archivePath: string): Promise<ArchiveEntry[]>;

    try {
      const entries = tarGzEntries(archive);
      expect(entries.map((e) => e.name).sort()).toEqual(['NOTES', 'screepub']);

      const bin = entries.find((e) => e.name === 'screepub')!;
      expect(bin.size).toBe(1500);

      expect(bin.mode & 0o111).not.toBe(0);

      // The second entry proves the walk advanced past the first one's
      // padded 2048 bytes rather than stopping.
      expect(notes.mode & 0o111).toBe(0);
    } finally {
      rmSync(dir, { recursive: true, force: true });
    }

    } finally {
      rmSync(dir, { recursive: true, force: true });
    }
  });
});
```

Add `chmodSync` and `mkdirSync` to the `node:fs` import at the top of the test file.

> If `zipEntries` comes back with `mode === 0`, jszip did not surface the permissions: read the high 16 bits of the central-directory external attributes yourself rather than dropping the assertion. The executable bit is one of the two things this reader exists to see.

Expected: FAIL — `tarGzEntries` is not exported.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

Add to `tools/build-cli.ts` (add `readFileSync` if not already imported, and `basename`/`extname` are not needed here):

```ts
export interface ArchiveEntry {

  size: number;
  /** Unix mode as recorded in the archive. 0 when the format carries none. */
  mode: number;

### Task 6: Packaging

tar.gz for Linux, zip for Windows, matching what each platform's users can open without installing anything. The binary is named plainly inside both, so `tar -xzf` and `Expand-Archive` each leave a runnable file in the current directory — the same arrangement the macOS tarballs already have, and what the Homebrew formula's `bin.install` relies on there.

The executable bit is set explicitly before packing rather than inherited. On Linux it is what makes the download runnable at all; in the zip it is what a WSL or macOS user gets when they unpack a Windows build to inspect it.

**Files:**
- Modify: `tools/build-cli.ts`
- Test: `tests/build-cli.test.ts` (append)

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `export function packageTarget(target: Target, outDir: string): Promise<string>;` — returns the archive path.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Append to `tests/build-cli.test.ts`:

```ts
describe('packageTarget', () => {
  /** Stage a small stand-in binary exactly where compileTarget would have
   *  left one, so packaging is tested without a 100 MB compile. */
  function stage(target: Target, bytes: Uint8Array): string {
    const dir = mkdtempSync(join(tmpdir(), 'screepub-pack-'));
    mkdirSync(buildDir(target, dir), { recursive: true });
    writeFileSync(binaryPath(target, dir), bytes);
    return dir;
  }

  test('a Linux target becomes a tar.gz holding one executable `screepub`', async () => {

    payload.set([0x7f, 0x45, 0x4c, 0x46, 2, 1, 1, 0], 0);
    new DataView(payload.buffer).setUint16(0x12, 0xb7, true);
    const dir = stage(target, payload);
    try {
      // Deliberately NOT executable on disk first: packaging must set the
      // bit, not inherit whatever the compiler happened to leave.
      chmodSync(binaryPath(target, dir), 0o644);
      const archive = await packageTarget(target, dir);
      expect(archive).toBe(join(dir, 'screepub-cli-linux-arm64.tar.gz'));

      // aarch64 ELF after the round trip.
      expect(detectBinaryFormat(entries[0]!.data)).toBe('elf-aarch64');
    } finally {
      rmSync(dir, { recursive: true, force: true });
    }
  });

  test('the Windows target becomes a zip holding one `screepub.exe`', async () => {
    const target = TARGETS.find((t) => t.id === 'windows-x64')!;
    const payload = new Uint8Array(3000);
    payload.set([0x4d, 0x5a], 0);
    const v = new DataView(payload.buffer);
    v.setUint32(0x3c, 0x78, true);

    } finally {
      rmSync(dir, { recursive: true, force: true });
    }
  });

  test('re-packaging replaces the archive instead of appending to it', async () => {

    const dir = stage(target, new Uint8Array(3000));

      await packageTarget(target, dir);
      const entries = await archiveEntries(archivePath(target, dir));
      expect(entries.length).toBe(1);
    } finally {
      rmSync(dir, { recursive: true, force: true });
    }
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `bun test tests/build-cli.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — `packageTarget` is not exported.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

Add to `tools/build-cli.ts` (add `chmodSync`, `rmSync`, `writeFileSync` to the `node:fs` import):

```ts

      throw new Error(`build-cli: tar failed for ${target.id}: ${proc.stderr.toString().trim()}`);
    }
  } else {
    const JSZip = (await import('jszip')).default;
    const zip = new JSZip();
    zip.file(target.binaryName, readFileSync(bin), { unixPermissions: 0o755 });
    const buf = await zip.generateAsync({
      type: 'nodebuffer',
      // UNIX, so the permission bits above are actually written into the
      // central directory rather than discarded.
      platform: 'UNIX',
      compression: 'DEFLATE',
    });
    writeFileSync(out, buf);
  }
  return out;
}
```

### Task 7: Verification, which is the point of the tool

The spec's first acceptance criterion is that the tool "fails loudly if any artifact is missing, empty or the wrong format". Trusting the compiler's exit code is exactly the mistake this replaces: `bun build` can exit 0 and leave a truncated file, and a mis-typed `--target=` exits 0 while producing a perfectly valid binary for the wrong machine.

Eight checks, each of which must be able to fail. The size floors are **injectable** so every branch is exercised in milliseconds with tiny thresholds, while the production numbers are asserted separately and exercised for real in Task 11.

**Files:**
- Modify: `tools/build-cli.ts`
- Test: `tests/build-cli.test.ts` (append)

**Interfaces:**
- Produces:
  ```ts
  export interface Floors { binaryBytes: number; archiveBytes: number }

  export function verifyArtifact(target: Target, outDir: string, floors?: Floors): Promise<void>;

### Task 8: `SHA256SUMS`

A checksum file is only useful if the format is the one people's tools already speak: `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS` on Linux, `shasum -a 256 -c` on macOS.

### Task 9: `buildAll`, the command line, and the ignore rule

The orchestration is deliberately dull: check the version, then for each target compile, package and verify — **verify before moving on**, so a broken target fails at the target that broke rather than at a checksum three minutes later. Checksums cover exactly what was built.

The ignore rule matters because the tool is meant to be run by hand. `bun tools/build-cli.ts --out dist/` in the repo is the obvious thing to type, and it must not offer 250 MB to the next `git add -A`.

**Files:**
- Modify: `tools/build-cli.ts`
- Test: `tests/build-cli.test.ts` (append)

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `export function buildAll(args: BuildArgs, floors?: Floors): Promise<string[]>;` — returns absolute archive paths. Plus an `import.meta.main` entry point.
- Consumes: everything above.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Append to `tests/build-cli.test.ts`:

```ts
describe('buildAll', () => {
  test('refuses to build a version package.json does not name', async () => {
    const dir = mkdtempSync(join(tmpdir(), 'screepub-all-'));
    try {
      await expect(
        buildAll({ version: '99.0.0', outDir: dir, only: ['linux-x64'] }),
      ).rejects.toThrow(/package\.json/);
      // Nothing was compiled: the guard runs before any 100 MB write.
      expect(existsSync(buildDir(TARGETS[0]!, dir))).toBe(false);
    } finally {
      rmSync(dir, { recursive: true, force: true });
    }
  });
});

describe('the repo will not accidentally commit an artifact', () => {
  test('.gitignore covers the obvious hand-run output directories', () => {
    // `bun tools/build-cli.ts --out dist/` is the documented example, and
    // each artifact is 39-119 MB.
    for (const path of [
      'dist/screepub-cli-linux-x64.tar.gz',
      'dist/SHA256SUMS',
      'build/screepub-cli-windows-x64.zip',
    ]) {
      const proc = Bun.spawnSync(['git', 'check-ignore', '-q', path]);
      expect({ path, ignored: proc.exitCode === 0 }).toEqual({ path, ignored: true });
    }
  });
});

describe('the tool runs from a command line', () => {
  // A path that provably does not exist yet, so "it was never created" is a
  // real assertion rather than an accident of what /tmp happens to hold.
  const NEVER = join(tmpdir(), `screepub-never-${process.pid}-${Date.now()}`);

  test('a missing --version fails with a message and a non-zero exit', () => {
    const proc = Bun.spawnSync(['bun', 'tools/build-cli.ts', '--out', NEVER], {
      stdout: 'pipe',
      stderr: 'pipe',
    });
    expect(proc.exitCode).not.toBe(0);
    expect(proc.stderr.toString()).toMatch(/--version/);
    expect(existsSync(NEVER)).toBe(false);
  });

  test('an unknown target is refused before anything is compiled', () => {
    const proc = Bun.spawnSync(
      ['bun', 'tools/build-cli.ts', '--version', '0.0.1', '--out', NEVER, '--only', 'darwin-arm64'],
      { stdout: 'pipe', stderr: 'pipe' },
    );
    expect(proc.exitCode).not.toBe(0);
    expect(proc.stderr.toString()).toMatch(/darwin-arm64/);
    // Nothing was created: the refusal happens during argument parsing, so
    // a mistyped target never costs a 100 MB write.
    expect(existsSync(NEVER)).toBe(false);
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `bun test tests/build-cli.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — `buildAll` is not exported.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

Add to `tools/build-cli.ts`:

```ts
/** Compile, package and verify one target at a time, verifying BEFORE
 *  moving on: a broken target then fails at the target that broke, not at
 *  a checksum three minutes later. */
export async function buildAll(args: BuildArgs, floors: Floors = RELEASE_FLOORS): Promise<string[]> {
  assertPackageVersion(args.version);
  mkdirSync(args.outDir, { recursive: true });

  const targets = TARGETS.filter((t) => args.only.includes(t.id));
  const names: string[] = [];
  for (const target of targets) {
    console.log(`── ${target.id} (${target.bunTarget})`);
    compileTarget(target, args.outDir);
    await packageTarget(target, args.outDir);
    await verifyArtifact(target, args.outDir, floors);
    const bytes = statSync(archivePath(target, args.outDir)).size;
    console.log(`   ${target.archiveName}  ${bytes} bytes  ok`);
    names.push(target.archiveName);
  }

  writeChecksums(args.outDir, names);
  return names.map((n) => join(args.outDir, n));
}

if (import.meta.main) {
  try {
    const args = parseBuildArgs(Bun.argv.slice(2));
    const made = await buildAll(args);
    console.log(`\n${made.length} artifact(s) + SHA256SUMS in ${args.outDir}`);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error((err as Error).message);
    process.exit(1);
  }
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the suite**

Run: `bun test && bunx tsc --noEmit`
Expected: PASS — 799 + 49, `tsc` clean. Then run the tool for real against one target, into the scratch directory, and confirm it reports `ok`:

```bash
V="$(bun --print "require('./package.json').version")"
OUT="$(mktemp -d)"
bun tools/build-cli.ts --version "$V" --out "$OUT" --only windows-x64
ls -l "$OUT"; cat "$OUT/SHA256SUMS"; rm -rf "$OUT"
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add tools/build-cli.ts tests/build-cli.test.ts
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'

### Task 10: `tools/smoke-cli.ts`

Cross-compiling is not cross-testing. A Windows binary built on Linux has never executed, so each OS runs its own artifact and proves three things: `--version` agrees with `package.json`, the committed fixture converts to a real EPUB, and `devices --json` starts.

It is a Bun script rather than two shell fragments because the alternative is one script in bash and one in PowerShell, drifting, neither testable. It imports nothing outside Node built-ins so a Windows runner needs no `bun install`. Every assertion is a pure function over a captured result, so the whole failure ledger is unit-tested here and the real run happens in Task 11 and in CI.

`devices --json` returning an empty list **is a pass**: it proves the command ran, which is the point.

**Files:**
- Create: `tools/smoke-cli.ts`
- Test: `tests/smoke-cli.test.ts` (create)

**Interfaces:**
- Produces:
  ```ts
  export interface RunResult { exitCode: number; stdout: string; stderr: string }
  export type Runner = (argv: string[]) => RunResult;
  export function soleJson(stdout: string, what: string): Record<string, unknown>;
  export function checkVersion(result: RunResult, expected: string): void;
  export function checkConvertResult(result: RunResult, epubPath: string): void;
  export function checkEpubBytes(head: Uint8Array): void;
  export function checkDevices(result: RunResult): void;

### Task 11: One real build, end to end

Everything above is tested with crafted bytes and injected seams, which is what keeps it fast and precise — and which is also exactly how a build tool can be entirely green and produce nothing. This test compiles for real, packages for real, verifies at the **production floors**, checks the checksums against independently computed digests, and — when the host can execute one of the targets — runs the binary through the full smoke path.

Two targets, not three: linux-arm64 and linux-x64 share a code path, so the pair worth exercising is *a tar.gz Linux target* and *the zip Windows target*. The Linux one is the host's own architecture wherever the host has one, so the binary that gets run is a binary this machine can actually run. On a Mac, `hostTarget()` is `undefined` by design, the Linux target falls back to linux-x64, and the smoke half self-skips with a printed note; CI's Ubuntu jobs cover it there.

Measured cost on this machine: compiles are sub-second warm and about 2 s cold, `tar -czf` of a 103 MB binary is 3.1 s, the zip is 4.4 s, and reading both back is a few seconds more — roughly 15-20 s added to a 9 s suite.

**Files:**
- Create: `tests/build-cli-e2e.test.ts`

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Before implementing anything, prove the test can fail rather than pass by accident. Temporarily change `RELEASE_FLOORS.binaryBytes` in `tools/build-cli.ts` to `0` and re-run: the truncated-binary test must fail. Then temporarily change `windows-x64`'s `format` to `'elf-x86-64'` and re-run: the format assertions must fail. Restore both.

Run: `bun test tests/build-cli-e2e.test.ts`
Expected: with the tampering in place, FAIL; restored, PASS in roughly 15-20 s.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

No source change — Tasks 1-10 are the implementation. If this test fails, the defect is in `build-cli.ts` or `smoke-cli.ts`, not here.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the suite**

Run: `bun test && bunx tsc --noEmit && git status --short`
Expected: PASS — 799 + 65, `tsc` clean, and `git status` shows only the intended source files: **no artifact anywhere in the tree.**

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/build-cli-e2e.test.ts
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'

### Task 12: The macOS path, pinned

The decisive constraint of this piece is negative: the macOS artifacts must keep being produced by exactly the code that produces them today. `app/release.sh` signs and notarizes them, and notarization needs Apple's toolchain on a Mac — a cross-compiled Mach-O could not be notarized from Linux, so "unifying" the builds would trade a Gatekeeper-clean download for a scary warning. `tools/bump-tap.sh` then hardcodes the two filenames, and the tap has its own freshness alarm.

These tests are the standing guard. The byte-for-byte proof is in Final Verification; what lives here is the invariant that outlives this piece — the names, and the absence of a macOS row in the new builder.

The action-pin test is here for the same reason: Task 14 adds two third-party actions, the repo pins every action to a SHA, and an unpinned one is the kind of thing that gets noticed a year later.

**Files:**
- Create: `tests/release-artifacts.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `TARGETS` from `tools/build-cli.ts`; the workflow and script files as text.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Create `tests/release-artifacts.test.ts`:

```ts
import { describe, test, expect } from 'bun:test';
import { readFileSync, readdirSync } from 'node:fs';
import { join } from 'node:path';
import { TARGETS } from '../tools/build-cli';

const WORKFLOWS = '.github/workflows';
const read = (p: string) => readFileSync(p, 'utf8');

const MACOS_ASSETS = [
  'Screepub-macOS.dmg',
  'screepub-cli-macos-arm64.tar.gz',
  'screepub-cli-macos-x64.tar.gz',
];

describe('the macOS release path is untouched by the cross-platform builder', () => {
  test('the cross builder emits no macOS artifact, by name or by target', () => {
    // app/release.sh signs and NOTARIZES the macOS binaries, which needs
    // Apple's toolchain on a Mac. A cross-compiled Mach-O could not be
    // notarized, so an added darwin row here would quietly replace a
    // Gatekeeper-clean download with a warning screen.
    for (const t of TARGETS) {
      expect(t.bunTarget).not.toContain('darwin');
      expect(t.format.startsWith('macho')).toBe(false);
      expect(t.archiveName.toLowerCase()).not.toContain('macos');
      expect(t.archiveName.toLowerCase()).not.toContain('darwin');
    }
    for (const name of MACOS_ASSETS) {
      expect(TARGETS.some((t) => t.archiveName === name)).toBe(false);
    }
  });

  test('app/release.sh still produces the two tarballs and the DMG', () => {
    const sh = read('app/release.sh');
    expect(sh).toContain('screepub-cli-macos-$ARCH.tar.gz');
    expect(sh).toContain('Screepub-macOS.dmg');
    expect(sh).toContain('notarytool submit');
  });

  test('tools/bump-tap.sh still names exactly the macOS assets, and nothing else', () => {
    // The Homebrew tap serves the macOS CLI. It must not learn about the
    // Linux or Windows artifacts: brew has no business installing either,
    // and tap-freshness.yml would go red on a formula it cannot audit.
    const sh = read('tools/bump-tap.sh');
    for (const name of MACOS_ASSETS) expect(sh).toContain(name);
    expect(sh.toLowerCase()).not.toContain('linux');
    expect(sh.toLowerCase()).not.toContain('windows');
    for (const t of TARGETS) expect(sh).not.toContain(t.archiveName);
  });
});

describe('every workflow action is pinned to a commit', () => {
  test('no `uses:` rides a mutable tag', () => {
    const offenders: string[] = [];
    for (const file of readdirSync(WORKFLOWS).filter((f) => f.endsWith('.yml'))) {
      for (const line of read(join(WORKFLOWS, file)).split('\n')) {
        const m = /^\s*-?\s*uses:\s*(\S+)/.exec(line);
        if (!m) continue;
        if (!/@[0-9a-f]{40}$/.test(m[1]!)) offenders.push(`${file}: ${m[1]}`);
      }
    }
    expect(offenders).toEqual([]);
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `bun test tests/release-artifacts.test.ts`
Expected: PASS immediately — these are regression pins, not drivers. Prove they can fail before trusting them:

1. Temporarily add a `darwin-arm64` row to `TARGETS` with `archiveName: 'screepub-cli-macos-arm64.tar.gz'` and re-run: the first two assertions must fail. Remove it.
2. Temporarily append `screepub-cli-linux-x64.tar.gz` to a comment in `tools/bump-tap.sh` and re-run: the tap test must fail. **Revert with `git checkout -- tools/bump-tap.sh`** — that file is otherwise untouchable.
3. Temporarily change one `uses:` in `ci.yml` to `actions/checkout@v7` and re-run: the pin test must fail. Revert.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

No source change.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the suite**

Run: `bun test && bunx tsc --noEmit && git status --short app/ tools/bump-tap.sh tools/check-tap.sh`
Expected: PASS — 799 + 69, `tsc` clean, and the `git status` prints **nothing**.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/release-artifacts.test.ts
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'

### Task 13: CI gets the cross-compile

The spec asks for the cross-compile as a cheap early signal, so a target breaking is a red push rather than a surprise at tag time. Ubuntu is free, the whole job is about a minute, and it also runs the linux-x64 artifact through the real smoke path — so on every push, one compiled binary is genuinely executed, converted with, and asked for its device list.

This does **not** replace the existing `artifact` job on macOS: that one builds the host binary and runs `epubcheck`, which is the project's stated validity gate and needs Homebrew.

**Files:**
- Modify: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Test: `tests/release-artifacts.test.ts` (append)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `tools/build-cli.ts`, `tools/smoke-cli.ts`.
- Produces: a `cross-cli` job in `ci.yml`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Append to `tests/release-artifacts.test.ts` (add `describe`-level YAML parsing):

```ts
interface Job {
  'runs-on'?: string;
  needs?: string | string[];
  permissions?: Record<string, string>;
  steps?: { name?: string; uses?: string; run?: string; shell?: string; with?: Record<string, unknown> }[];
}
interface Workflow {
  jobs: Record<string, Job>;
}

const workflow = (file: string): Workflow =>
  Bun.YAML.parse(read(join(WORKFLOWS, file))) as Workflow;

const runText = (job: Job): string => (job.steps ?? []).map((s) => s.run ?? '').join('\n');

describe('ci.yml cross-compiles on every push', () => {
  const ci = workflow('ci.yml');

  test('a cross-cli job builds every target on a free runner', () => {
    const job = ci.jobs['cross-cli'];
    expect(job).toBeDefined();
    expect(job!['runs-on']).toBe('ubuntu-latest');
    const text = runText(job!);
    expect(text).toContain('tools/build-cli.ts');
    // No --only: the point is that ALL THREE targets keep compiling.
    expect(text).not.toContain('--only');
  });

  test('it runs the linux-x64 artifact rather than only building it', () => {
    const text = runText(ci.jobs['cross-cli']!);
    expect(text).toContain('screepub-cli-linux-x64.tar.gz');
    expect(text).toContain('tools/smoke-cli.ts');
  });

  test('the macOS artifact job is untouched and still runs epubcheck', () => {
    // The compiled-binary + epubcheck gate predates this piece and is not
    // replaced by the cheap Linux one.
    const artifact = ci.jobs['artifact'];
    expect(artifact!['runs-on']).toBe('macos-15');
    expect(runText(artifact!)).toContain('epubcheck');
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `bun test tests/release-artifacts.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — there is no `cross-cli` job in `ci.yml`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

Append to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, after the `artifact` job:

```yaml
  # Bun cross-compiles every target from one machine, so a broken target is
  # a red push instead of a surprise at tag time. The verification lives in
  # tools/build-cli.ts, which is unit-tested and hand-runnable; this job is
  # a thin caller, because a build matrix expressed in YAML can only ever be
  # tested by cutting a release.
  #
  # It does NOT replace the `artifact` job above: that one runs epubcheck,
  # the project's stated validity gate, and needs Homebrew.
  cross-cli:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@3d3c42e5aac5ba805825da76410c181273ba90b1 # v7.0.1
      - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@0c5077e51419868618aeaa5fe8019c62421857d6 # v2.2.0
        with:
          bun-version: 1.3.14
      - run: bun install --frozen-lockfile
      - name: Cross-compile every CLI target and verify the binary formats
        run: |
          set -euo pipefail
          V="$(bun --print "require('./package.json').version")"
          bun tools/build-cli.ts --version "$V" --out "$RUNNER_TEMP/cli"
      - name: The linux-x64 artifact actually runs here
        run: |
          set -euo pipefail
          tar -xzf "$RUNNER_TEMP/cli/screepub-cli-linux-x64.tar.gz" -C "$RUNNER_TEMP"
          bun tools/smoke-cli.ts --binary "$RUNNER_TEMP/screepub"
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the suite**

Run: `bun test && bunx tsc --noEmit`
Expected: PASS — 799 + 72, `tsc` clean. Also confirm the file still parses as a workflow:

```bash
bun -e 'console.log(Object.keys((Bun.YAML.parse(require("fs").readFileSync(".github/workflows/ci.yml","utf8")) as any).jobs))'
```
Expected: `[ "engine", "app", "artifact", "cross-cli" ]`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml tests/release-artifacts.test.ts
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'

### Task 14: The release workflow gains four jobs

Build once, test per OS, then upload. `cross-cli` builds all three artifacts on a free Ubuntu runner and hands them on; `smoke-linux-x64` and `smoke-windows-x64` each download their own artifact and run it on its own operating system; `cross-upload` attaches them to the release only after both pass. The Windows smoke job is the first execution the Windows binary will ever have had, so it gating the upload is the entire point of the arrangement.

**The existing jobs are not edited.** `checks`, `release`, `tap` and `tap-check` keep their current text byte for byte, the release is still created and un-drafted by the macOS `release` job, and the macOS assets still go up from there. The new assets arrive a minute later; that is preferable to moving the un-draft into a job whose failure would leave a release permanently in draft.

`cross-upload` has no checkout, so `gh` is told which repository it is talking to via `GH_REPO`.

**Files:**
- Modify: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- Test: `tests/release-artifacts.test.ts` (append)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `tools/build-cli.ts`, `tools/smoke-cli.ts`.
- Produces: `cross-cli`, `smoke-linux-x64`, `smoke-windows-x64`, `cross-upload` jobs.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `bun test tests/release-artifacts.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — there is no `cross-cli` job in `release.yml`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

First get the two action pins (the repo pins every action to a commit, and Task 12's test enforces it):

```bash
gh api repos/actions/upload-artifact/commits/v4 -q .sha
gh api repos/actions/download-artifact/commits/v4 -q .sha
```

Use those forty-hex values below in place of `ea165f8d65b6e75b540449e92b4886f43607fa02` / `d3f86a106a0bac45b974a628896c90dbdf5c8093`, keeping the `# v4` comment beside each, exactly as the existing pins are written. (`pinact run` does the same job if it is installed.)

Append to `.github/workflows/release.yml`, after the `tap-check` job:

```yaml
  # Bun cross-compiles every target from one machine, so the Linux and
  # Windows artifacts cost one free Ubuntu runner rather than a per-OS build
  # matrix. The macOS artifacts are NOT built here: app/release.sh signs and
  # notarizes them on the macOS runner above, notarization needs Apple's
  # toolchain, and tools/bump-tap.sh hardcodes their filenames.
  #
  # The matrix and every verification live in tools/build-cli.ts, which is

Run: `bun test && bunx tsc --noEmit && git diff --stat main -- app/ tools/bump-tap.sh tools/check-tap.sh .github/workflows/tap-freshness.yml`
Expected: PASS — 799 + 79, `tsc` clean, and the `git diff --stat` prints **nothing**. Then confirm the graph:

```bash
bun -e 'const w=Bun.YAML.parse(require("fs").readFileSync(".github/workflows/release.yml","utf8"));
for (const [k,v] of Object.entries(w.jobs)) console.log(k, "<-", JSON.stringify(v.needs ?? null), v["runs-on"]);'
```
Expected: the four original jobs unchanged, plus `cross-cli <- "checks"`, both smoke jobs `<- "cross-cli"`, and `cross-upload <- ["release","smoke-linux-x64","smoke-windows-x64"]`.

Also re-run the bash-3.2 guard, since `release.yml` changed: `bun test tests/workflow-shell.test.ts` must still pass (none of the new YAML uses a bash array).

### Task 15: Say the two things out loud

Both limits go where a reader meets them, not where they discover them.

**Windows binaries are unsigned.** Authenticode certificates cost money and that is out of scope by explicit instruction, so SmartScreen will warn on first run. A reader who has been told that clicks through it; a reader who has not assumes the download is malware.

**Device support on Windows and Linux is unproven on hardware.** The device code has met exactly one real Kindle, on a Mac. Windows volume enumeration has never run at all, and a tolino cannot be detected on Windows even in principle: it is identified by volume name, and a Windows drive root carries none.

One more guard rides along. `release.yml`'s `checks` job greps the notes for `sha-?256` and fails the tag, because two checksum lists on one page both look official — and it fails *after* the tag is pushed. Adding the term to the in-suite banned list moves that failure from minutes-after-tagging to nine seconds.

**Files:**
- Create: `docs/releases/0.6.0.md`
- Modify: `README.md`, `tests/release-notes.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the existing `BANNED` list and word cap in `tests/release-notes.test.ts`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

In `tests/release-notes.test.ts`, extend `BANNED`:

```ts
const BANNED = [
  'kepub',
  'sideload',
  'ragged-right',
  'keep-together',
  'rendering engine',
  'stylesheet',
  '—', // em dash: house rule for user-facing copy
  // release.yml's `checks` job fails a tag whose notes name a checksum,
  // because the workflow appends the real ones and two lists on one page
  // both look official. That check runs AFTER the tag is pushed; this one
  // runs in nine seconds.
  'sha256',
  'sha-256',
];
```

Then append to `tests/release-artifacts.test.ts`:

```ts
describe('the two limits are stated where a reader meets them', () => {
  const readme = read('README.md');

  test('the README says the Windows download is unsigned', () => {
    const lower = readme.toLowerCase();
    expect(lower).toContain('windows');
    expect(lower).toContain('smartscreen');
    expect(/not signed|unsigned/.test(lower)).toBe(true);
  });

  test('the README names each Linux and Windows artifact it tells people to download', () => {
    for (const t of TARGETS) expect(readme).toContain(t.archiveName);
  });

  test('the README says device support off macOS is unproven, and names the tolino case', () => {
    const lower = readme.toLowerCase();
    expect(lower).toContain('tolino');
    // The specific, checkable claim: on Windows a tolino cannot be detected
    // at all, because it is identified by volume name and a Windows drive
    // root carries none.
    expect(/tolino[^.]*windows|windows[^.]*tolino/s.test(lower)).toBe(true);
  });

  test('the 0.6.0 notes carry both limits', () => {
    const notes = read('docs/releases/0.6.0.md').toLowerCase();
    expect(notes).toContain('windows');
    expect(/not signed|unsigned/.test(notes)).toBe(true);
    expect(notes).toContain('tolino');
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `bun test tests/release-artifacts.test.ts tests/release-notes.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL — `docs/releases/0.6.0.md` does not exist and the README says nothing about Windows.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

Create `docs/releases/0.6.0.md`. (If a later piece has already created it, add these sections rather than replacing the file.) Note the constraints: no em dash, no banned term, no word for a checksum, 350 words maximum.

```markdown
# Screepub 0.6.0

Screepub now runs on Linux and Windows, from the command line.

## Screepub runs where you work

- **Linux and Windows downloads.** The converter ships as one file for Linux,
  on both Intel and ARM, and for Windows. Unpack it, run it, convert a script.
  There is nothing else to install.
- **The Mac app has not changed.** Same download, same signing by Apple, same
  behaviour. If you use Screepub on a Mac, this release asks nothing of you.

## Getting a script onto a reader

- **Two commands on the command line.** `screepub devices` lists the readers it
  can see, and `screepub send` copies a finished file onto one.

## Good to know

- **Windows will warn you the first time you run it.** The Windows download
  carries no certificate, so Windows shows a "publisher unknown" screen. Choose
  More info, then Run anyway. A certificate costs money this project does not
  spend yet, and we would rather tell you than let you meet that screen alone.
- **Sending to a reader has only been tried on a Mac, with a Kindle.**
  Everything else is built and code-tested but has never met real hardware. On
  Windows in particular, a tolino cannot be found at all: it is recognised by
  the name of its drive, and a Windows drive root has no name to read.
- **The ARM Linux download is built and checked but never run by our tests.**
  Nothing in our automation has an ARM machine to run it on. It is the version
  the author uses daily, which is not the same as proof.
```

Then in `README.md`, after the `**Requirements:** macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later…` paragraph in the **Install** section, insert:

````markdown
### Linux and Windows (command line)

There is no window to open yet on Linux or Windows: what ships is the
converter itself, run from a terminal. Download the file for your machine
from the [latest release](https://github.com/ssandweiss/screepub/releases/latest),
unpack it, and run it.

| Machine | File |
| --- | --- |
| Linux, Intel or AMD | `screepub-cli-linux-x64.tar.gz` |
| Linux, ARM (Asahi, Raspberry Pi, ARM servers) | `screepub-cli-linux-arm64.tar.gz` |
| Windows, 64-bit | `screepub-cli-windows-x64.zip` |

```bash
tar -xzf screepub-cli-linux-x64.tar.gz
./screepub script.pdf
```

`SHA256SUMS` on the release page covers these three files, for anyone who
wants to check what they downloaded.

**Windows will warn you.** The Windows build carries no code-signing
certificate, so SmartScreen shows a "publisher unknown" screen the first time
you run it. Choose **More info**, then **Run anyway**. Certificates cost money
this project does not spend yet; this note exists so the warning is expected
rather than alarming.

**Device support off macOS is unproven.** `screepub devices` and
`screepub send` are built for all three platforms and code-tested on all
three, but the only device transfer anyone has ever run on real hardware was a
Kindle, on a Mac. Windows drive enumeration has never run against a real
reader, and a tolino cannot be detected on Windows at all: it is identified by
the name of its volume, and a Windows drive root carries none. Converting is
the part that is well tested everywhere; sending is not.
````

Finally, in the **Device commands** subsection, extend the existing hardware caveat paragraph so it ends with one more sentence:

```markdown
On Linux and Windows this caveat is stronger still: no device of any kind has
been connected to Screepub on either operating system. See
[Linux and Windows](#linux-and-windows-command-line) above.
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the suite**

Run: `bun test && bunx tsc --noEmit`
Expected: PASS — 799 + 83, `tsc` clean. Then run the tag-time check the release workflow will run, against the new notes:

```bash
grep -niE 'sha-?256|[0-9a-f]{64}' docs/releases/0.6.0.md && echo "FAIL: a tag would be rejected" || echo "ok"
wc -w docs/releases/0.6.0.md   # must be <= 350
```
Expected: `ok`, and a word count under 350.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add docs/releases/0.6.0.md README.md tests/release-notes.test.ts tests/release-artifacts.test.ts
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'

)"
```

---

## Final Verification

The spec's six acceptance criteria, as checkable steps.

- [ ] **1. `bun tools/build-cli.ts` produces all three artifacts plus `SHA256SUMS`, and fails loudly if any is missing, empty or the wrong format**

Run the tool by hand, outside the repo:

```bash
V="$(bun --print "require('./package.json').version")"
OUT="$(mktemp -d)"
bun tools/build-cli.ts --version "$V" --out "$OUT"
ls -l "$OUT"
cat "$OUT/SHA256SUMS"
file "$OUT"/*/screepub "$OUT"/*/screepub.exe
(cd "$OUT" && sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS)
```
Expected: three archives plus `SHA256SUMS`; `file` reports `ELF 64-bit … x86-64`, `ELF 64-bit … ARM aarch64` and `PE32+ … x86-64`; `sha256sum -c` prints three `OK` lines.

Now prove it refuses a build it should refuse, from the command line:

```bash
bun tools/build-cli.ts --version 99.0.0 --out "$OUT" ; echo "exit=$?"
bun tools/build-cli.ts --version "$V" --out "$OUT" --only darwin-arm64 ; echo "exit=$?"
rm -rf "$OUT"
```
Expected: the first prints the package.json mismatch and exits non-zero; the second names `darwin-arm64` and exits non-zero. **No macOS target can be built by this tool at all.**

The eight artifact-rejection branches (missing, 0-byte, small, wrong architecture, not a binary, missing archive, archive without the member, member without the executable bit) cannot be provoked from the command line, because a re-run simply recompiles a good artifact over the damaged one. They are covered by `bun test tests/build-cli.test.ts -t verifyArtifact`, and the production floors rejecting a truncated **real** binary is covered by `bun test tests/build-cli-e2e.test.ts -t "not vacuous"`. Run both and confirm they pass.

- [ ] **2a. The macOS artifacts, the DMG and the tap bump are byte-unchanged**

```bash
sha256sum app/release.sh app/build-lib.sh tools/bump-tap.sh tools/check-tap.sh
```
Expected, exactly:

```
5d1e1e729711a1b5c70e9f2300359bbea0481287ee5c94c6e7a28eff39ef7670  app/release.sh
424938158445b127389bed7bc6367c564254e0859a7e5c85c0a8fa3e13d841b9  app/build-lib.sh
f6245bcd9884ceeb0584f827b22e53c680252d1006fe491b64dc53dadf2a7f68  tools/bump-tap.sh
f1f1b1a430bd1b6b90c5c31dc2d1af5ada975a78a7ac7f84c8db0788d41db0ab  tools/check-tap.sh
```

- [ ] **2b. Nothing under `app/`, the tap scripts or the tap workflow is modified**

```bash
git diff --stat main -- app/ tools/bump-tap.sh tools/check-tap.sh .github/workflows/tap-freshness.yml
```
Expected: no output.

- [ ] **2c. The macOS half of `release.yml` is unchanged**

```bash
git diff main -- .github/workflows/release.yml | grep '^-' | grep -v '^---'
```
Expected: no output. Every hunk in that file is an addition; if a line was removed or altered inside `checks`, `release`, `tap` or `tap-check`, stop and restore it.

- [ ] **3. The release workflow uploads the new artifacts beside the old ones**

Run: `bun test tests/release-artifacts.test.ts`
Expected: pass. Then read the graph back from the file itself:

```bash
bun -e 'const w=Bun.YAML.parse(require("fs").readFileSync(".github/workflows/release.yml","utf8"));
for (const [k,v] of Object.entries(w.jobs)) console.log(k, "<-", JSON.stringify(v.needs ?? null), v["runs-on"]);'
```
Expected: `checks`, `release`, `tap`, `tap-check` exactly as before, plus `cross-cli <- "checks"` (ubuntu), `smoke-linux-x64 <- "cross-cli"` (ubuntu), `smoke-windows-x64 <- "cross-cli"` (windows-latest), `cross-upload <- ["release","smoke-linux-x64","smoke-windows-x64"]` (ubuntu). Confirm by eye that the `release` job's `gh release upload` still lists the DMG and the two macOS tarballs and nothing else.

- [ ] **4. linux-x64 and windows-x64 are smoke-tested on their own OS**

Run: `bun test tests/smoke-cli.test.ts tests/build-cli-e2e.test.ts`
Expected: pass, including the real host-binary smoke run (or its printed skip on a Mac). The per-OS half rides on the next tag by construction — a Windows binary cannot be executed here. What is verifiable now is that both jobs exist, run `tools/smoke-cli.ts`, each name their own archive, and that `cross-upload` waits for both; the test above asserts all four.

Confirm the two `--json` invocations the smoke tool depends on still behave, using this machine's own build:

```bash
OUT="$(mktemp -d)"
bun tools/build-cli.ts --version "$(bun --print "require('./package.json').version")" \
  --out "$OUT" --only "$(bun -e 'console.log(require("./tools/build-cli").hostTarget()?.id ?? "linux-x64")')"
bun tools/smoke-cli.ts --binary "$OUT"/*/screepub
rm -rf "$OUT"
```
Expected: `smoke: … converts, reports <version>, and lists devices`. On a Mac this step has no host target and is skipped.

- [ ] **5. The full existing suite passes, `tsc` is clean, nothing under `app/` is modified**

Run: `bun test && bunx tsc --noEmit && git status --short app/`
Expected: all pass (799 pre-existing + ~83 new), 3 skipped as before, `tsc` silent, `git status` empty.

Then confirm the committed fixtures are untouched and still reproduce:

```bash
bun test tests/fixture-stability.test.ts
git status --short tests/fixtures/
```
Expected: pass, and no output.

And confirm no artifact escaped into the tree:

```bash
git status --short
find . -name 'screepub-cli-*' -not -path './node_modules/*' -not -path './.git/*'
du -sh .git
```
Expected: `git status` shows only intended source files; `find` prints nothing; `.git` has not grown by hundreds of megabytes.

- [ ] **6. README and release notes state the unsigned-Windows and unproven-hardware limits**

Run: `bun test tests/release-artifacts.test.ts tests/release-notes.test.ts`
Expected: pass. Then read both by eye — a test can check that the word "SmartScreen" appears; only a person can check that the paragraph around it is honest and does not read as an apology or a dismissal.

Finally, run the tag-time notes checks that `release.yml` will run, before a tag exists to run them:

```bash
grep -niE 'sha-?256|[0-9a-f]{64}' docs/releases/0.6.0.md && echo "FAIL" || echo "ok"
wc -w docs/releases/0.6.0.md
iconv -f UTF-8 -t UTF-8 docs/releases/0.6.0.md >/dev/null && echo "utf8 ok"
```
Expected: `ok`, a word count at or under 350, `utf8 ok`.

- [ ] **7. The two tools really are the logic, and the YAML really is thin**

```bash
grep -c 'run:' .github/workflows/release.yml
grep -n 'bun build --compile' .github/workflows/*.yml
```
Expected: the second command prints **nothing**. If a `bun build --compile` has appeared in YAML, the build matrix has started leaking back into a place no test can reach, and the spec's central mitigation is gone.
