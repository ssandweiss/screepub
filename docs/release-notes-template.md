# Release notes: the template

Screepub's readers are screenwriters, producers and executives. They read
scripts on a Kindle. They do not read our source, our commit log, or this
repository at all. The notes exist to tell one of those people what is
different about the script they are about to convert.

This file is the whole brief. It is written so that someone with no memory
of any previous release can open it, read the last two release files, and
produce notes in the same voice at the same length.

Every release file lives at `docs/releases/<version>.md` and looks like
this, in this order:

```markdown
# Screepub <version>

<one line, only if privacy, requirements or the network surface changed>

<lede: one sentence>

## <heading named for the reader's outcome>

- **Claim in the reader's words.** Explanation.

## <heading named for who was affected>

- **Claim in the reader's words.** Explanation.

## Good to know

- <caveat>

*<optional italic closer>*
```

No date line. No version-bump commentary. No checksum: the workflow appends
the real one, and two SHAs on one page both look official.

## 0. Read these before you write a word

1. **The two most recent files in `docs/releases/`.** Match their length
   and their vocabulary. This is how voice actually transfers. The caps
   below are ceilings; the last two files are the target.
2. **The range facts** (`tools/release-notes.ts` output): what changed,
   which registry verdicts opened and which resolved.
3. **`docs/formatting-options-log.md`** for any behavior you are writing
   about. Read it for FACTS. See the contamination warning in section 5.
4. **`app/Sources/ScreepubApp/ReaderRail.swift`** if a bullet announces a
   new switch. That file holds the exact label the reader will see.

## 1. Caps, with 0.5.0's actuals as calibration

Word counts are `wc -w` on the file, H1 included. Verified against
`docs/releases/0.5.0.md`.

| Piece | Cap | 0.5.0 actual |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Whole file | 350 words | 325 |
| Lede | 1 sentence, 25 words | 12 |
| Change sections | 2 headings, 6 bullets TOTAL | 2 and 6 |
| One bullet | bold claim 10 words or fewer, plus 50 words or fewer of explanation | longest claim 9, longest explanation 46 |
| Good to know | 3 bullets | 2 |
| Closer | 1 paragraph, 70 words, optional | 47 |

Every actual is comfortably under its cap. That is the point. A release
that needs all 350 words is a release that has not been cut yet.

Six bullets TOTAL across both change sections. Not six per heading.

## 2. The cut ratio, with numbers

The 0.5.0 range held 40 commits: 37 non-merge, arriving both through 3
merged branches and straight onto main. It shipped 6 bullets.

One whole merged branch (`test-hardening`, 5 commits, 296 lines added)
produced nothing at all, because it changed only tests. Another branch
produced exactly one line of one bullet.

**The default disposition for a commit is NO bullet.** A commit earns a
bullet only when a reader who never opens the source would notice the
difference in a converted script: something looks different on the page,
something they could not do before now works, or something they were told
was true is not.

Things that routinely earn nothing: tests, refactors, docs, specs, plans,
build tooling, internal guards, review fixes to unreleased work, and any
change whose entire effect is that our own code is tidier. Do not reach
for these to fill space. A four-bullet release is a normal release.

When you finish, count the commits that earned nothing and be ready to say
the number. If it is small, you have probably not cut hard enough.

## 3. Five slots, not fixed headings

**Do NOT use New / Improved / Fixed / Changed as a fixed heading set.**
Readers do not care which changes were features and which were bugs. They
care what happens to their script. A heading that sorts by our engineering
category makes the reader do the translation we were supposed to do.

### Slot 1: the pre-lede line (usually absent)

One line, before the lede, if and only if this release changes privacy,
system requirements, or what the app touches on the network. The README
stakes the product's reputation on exactly five network touchpoints and on
"nothing is uploaded". A change there can never be a bullet buried under
improvements. Most releases skip this slot entirely.

Form: a single bold sentence in the reader's terms, for example
**"Screepub now needs macOS 15 or later."** State it, then move on. Do not
argue with it.

### Slot 2: the lede

One sentence naming the theme in reader terms. It answers "why should I
install this?" before any list.

0.5.0: *This release is about page turns: fewer awkward ones, on more
devices.*

It names an experience (page turns), not a subsystem. If you cannot write
this sentence, the release has no theme and the notes are a list, which is
a signal to cut further.

### Slot 3: improvements, under ONE heading

New and improved together, under a single heading named for the reader's
OUTCOME. Fallback if no honest outcome heading exists: `## What's new`.

0.5.0: `## Your scripts break better across pages`.

### Slot 4: fixes, under ONE heading

Under a single heading named for WHO was affected. Fallback:
`## What's fixed`.

0.5.0: `## Fixed for older Kindles`. A reader with a newer Kindle knows
instantly they can skip it. That is the heading doing its job.

A short intro sentence under a fix heading is allowed when it saves
repetition across the bullets, as 0.5.0 does with "Two settings were
quietly doing nothing when you saved a file for an older Kindle. Both work
now:". Those bullets then drop the bold-claim form, because the intro
already made the claim.

### Slot 5: Good to know, then the closer

`## Good to know` is the literal heading. Then the optional italic closer,
with no heading of its own. Rules in sections 9 and 10.

## 4. Bullet form

```markdown
- **Claim in the reader's words.** Explanation.
```

The bold claim must stand alone. Assume the reader reads the bold text and
nothing else, because most of them will. "**Apple Books stops changing
your formatting.**" survives that test. "**OPF metadata added.**" does not.

The explanation earns its words by answering the obvious next question:
what was it doing before, what does it do now, what do I do about it.

## 5. Voice rules

1. **Second person, present tense.** "Your script keeps its typewriter
   font", not "the script's font is now preserved".
2. **Keep screenplay vocabulary.** Dialogue, slugline, scene, character
   name, parenthetical, transition, title page, page turn. These are the
   reader's own words and they are precise. Do not soften them.
3. **Name devices and apps, not formats.** "Apple Books", "older Kindles",
   "Kobo". See section 7 for the one case where a format name is right.
4. **Say what the reader used to see when it was broken.** Nearly every
   good bullet has a past-tense problem clause: "They used to be a fixed
   gray that disappeared against dark and sepia backgrounds." Without it
   the reader cannot tell whether the change affects them.
5. **Ground defaults in print craft where that is honestly true.** "A
   printed script never leaves a single line of dialogue or action alone
   at the top or bottom of a page. Screepub now does the same." This
   reader knows print. Do not invent a craft justification that the
   registry does not support.
6. **Every new switch states its default AND the reason to change it.**
   "on by default. Turn it off if you'd rather fit more on each page."
   A switch with no stated reason to touch it reads as a switch nobody
   should touch.
7. **Name the control exactly as the reader rail labels it, once**, in the
   sentence that tells the reader they can change it. Get the string from
   `ReaderRail.swift`, not from the registry, which describes options in
   its own words. This applies when a bullet announces a new switch or
   invites the reader to go change something. A fix bullet that merely
   describes what an existing setting does may use plain English.
8. **Assign blame accurately, including to us.** "That's Amazon's rule,
   not ours" is fair because it is true. So is "Screepub's notes have been
   corrected." Never imply a device is at fault for something we did.
9. **No em dashes.** House rule. Use a colon, a period, or a comma.

### The contamination warning

`docs/formatting-options-log.md` and the commit log are your source
material, and they are written in em dashes and jargon. The registry
contains 132 of them. Commit subjects read like
"Wrapper keeps learn the column spelling (kepub/Readium), in its own rule
for iBooks".

**You are copying FACTS out of those files, not punctuation and not
vocabulary.** If a phrase in your draft would sit comfortably in the
registry, it does not belong in the notes. Read the fact, close the file,
and write the sentence from what you now know.

## 6. Say this, not that

| Do not write | Write instead |
| --- | --- |
| kepub | Kobo (name the device) |
| sideload, sideloaded | copied over USB |
| ragged-right | left-aligned the way a script should read |
| keep-together, keep-with-next, a keep (the noun) | stays with, travels with. The plain verb is fine: "your script keeps its typewriter font" |
| rendering engine, renderer, RMSDK, WebKit | name the device or app that does the rendering |
| stylesheet, CSS, selector | formatting |
| OPF, manifest, spine, metadata | say what the reader sees instead |
| monospace | typewriter font |
| dual dialogue | side-by-side dialogue when two characters talk at once |
| pagination, page-break behavior | page turns, how the script breaks across pages |
| option, flag, knob, toggle | switch, setting |
| widows and orphans, `widows: 2` | orphaned lines, a single line left alone at the top or bottom of a page |
| Enhanced Typesetting, KFX renderer | modern Kindles |
| `break-inside: avoid`, any property name | the instructions that hold a page together |
| iBooks | Apple Books |
| Readium, Thorium | several other reading apps |
| cue | character name |
| mini-slug | the smaller headings inside a scene |
| emits, renders, serializes, honors | Screepub now (verb the reader recognizes) |
| registry, entry #17, device verdict pending | hasn't been tested on a physical device yet |

The right column is not a thesaurus exercise. Every replacement above is
drawn from how the approved 0.5.0 notes actually phrase the same fact.

## 7. Naming a format

This is a principle, not a banned-word list. A banned-word list would
reject a correct sentence the approved notes already ship.

**Name a format only where the reader must ACT on it: a file they can see
and hand around, or a limitation they will hit. Never as a stage in our
pipeline.**

Passes: *"Kindles still can't read EPUB files copied over USB."* The
reader has a file with that extension, sitting in a folder, and needs to
know it will not work.

Fails: *"the EPUB renderer now emits..."* The reader cannot act on that.
It is our pipeline talking.

When the format is only an internal detail, describe it without naming it,
as 0.5.0 does: *"Switching it off used to remove the title page from one
file format but leave it in the other."*

EPUB, MOBI, AZW3 and KFX are not banned words. They are words that have to
earn their place by being something the reader touches.

## 8. Worked pairs

Left is what you will actually be reading. Right is what shipped in
`docs/releases/0.5.0.md`. These are calibration, not boilerplate: they
show how far a fact has to travel to become a sentence. Never paste one
into a new release.

### Pair 1: three commits, one bullet, and the one thing 0.5.0 got wrong

**Source**

- `ce65963 printSplitMinimums option: the print two-line rule gets a knob (registry #17)`
- `b27ca1c Dialogue and action carry widows/orphans: 2 by default, 1 for tight packing`
- `18f0ff6 Reader rail: Print-style split minimums toggle in the Page group`
- Registry #17: "`printSplitMinimums` emits `widows`/`orphans` on
  `p.dialogue` and `p.action`: ON = 2 (print's two-line rule at page
  edges), OFF = 1 (tight packing, the community's documented space-reclaim
  trick)."

**Notes**

> - **No more orphaned lines.** A printed script never leaves a single
>   line of dialogue or action alone at the top or bottom of a page.
>   Screepub now does the same. There's a new switch for it, on by
>   default. Turn it off if you'd rather fit more on each page.

**Why:** the property name, the element selectors and the numbers 2 and 1
all disappear. The print rule behind them survives, because that is the
part the reader can judge. One bullet absorbs the engine change, the CSS
and the app control, because to a reader they are one thing.

**The correction to carry forward:** this bullet never names the switch,
so a reader who wants it off cannot find it. Under rule 5.7 the last
sentence should have read: "Turn off **Print-style split minimums** in the
reader's formatting rail if you'd rather fit more on each page." Do that
next time.

### Pair 2: registry jargon at its worst

**Source**

- `3abeba3 Wrapper keeps learn the column spelling (kepub/Readium), in its own rule for iBooks`
- Registry #8b: "`.keep-together` additionally carries
  `-webkit-column-break-inside: avoid`, in a SEPARATE rule of its own,
  which extends this keep to Apple Books, whose WebKit honors only the old
  spelling, and to the Readium family."

**Notes**

> - **Character names stay with their dialogue on more devices.** This
>   already worked on Kindle. It now works in Apple Books and several
>   other reading apps, along with side-by-side dialogue when two
>   characters talk at once.

**Why:** "wrapper keeps", "column spelling", "kepub", "Readium" and
"iBooks" have no meaning to this reader, and four of them are on the say
this, not that table. What survives is the audience change: it used to
work in one place, now it works in more. "Dual dialogue" becomes the
sentence a person would say out loud.

### Pair 3: a change with no visible cause

**Source**

- `1a2ccb3 OPF carries ibooks:specified-fonts so Books honors our font and ragged-right`
- Registry #6b: "unless the package carries
  `<meta property="ibooks:specified-fonts">true</meta>`, a Books reader
  with Justify switched on overrides our ragged-right `text-align`
  outright (and our font-family with it)."

**Notes**

> - **Apple Books stops changing your formatting.** Your script keeps its
>   typewriter font, and lines stay left-aligned the way a script should
>   read, instead of being stretched to fill the width.

**Why:** the reader never sees metadata. They see a script that looked
wrong in one app. "Stretched to fill the width" is what justification
actually looks like to someone who did not ask for it.

### Pair 4: the past-tense problem clause doing all the work

**Source**

- `6ffcaf1 Page marker dims via opacity so every theme keeps it legible`
- Registry #13a: "the marker now recedes via `opacity: 0.6` instead of a
  hardcoded gray. A fixed gray was picked against a white page and fought
  every themed background."

**Notes**

> - **Page numbers stay readable in dark mode.** They used to be a fixed
>   gray that disappeared against dark and sepia backgrounds.

**Why:** 22 words, and the second sentence is the whole bullet. A reader
who never uses dark mode skips it correctly. A reader who does recognizes
the exact thing that annoyed them.

### Pair 5: two commits, one six-word line

**Source**

- `a7b7212 MOBI learns scene page breaks: mbp:pagebreak, the dialect's one primitive`
- `23c8830 MOBI page breaks follow primary scenes only, not mini-slugs (registry #5b)`

**Notes**, under `## Fixed for older Kindles` and its shared intro:

> - Start each scene on a new page.

**Why:** the second commit exists only because the first one was too
broad. The reader never had the broken intermediate version, so there is
nothing to tell them about it. Two commits, one setting, one line. The
heading and the intro sentence carry the who and the what, so the bullet
is just the setting's name.

### Pair 6: naming a format only where it is invisible

**Source**

- `a2f1183 MOBI honors includeTitlePage, and breaks where the EPUB breaks`
- Registry #11: "It had ignored it since the dialect was written: OFF
  dropped the EPUB's title file, manifest item, spine itemref and nav
  landmark and left the `.mobi` opening on a title page anyway."

**Notes**

> - Include the title page. Switching it off used to remove the title page
>   from one file format but leave it in the other.

**Why:** the reader cannot act on which of our two output files misbehaved.
They asked for no title page and got one. "One file format but leave it in
the other" is exactly as specific as the reader needs, and section 7 is
why neither format is named.

### Pair 7: a commit that earns nothing

**Source**

- `df1403a A selector-exact CSS rule extractor, with the shadowing case pinned`
- `9f96a6d options.test.ts extracts rules by exact selector, not by lucky regex`
- `a7c24c8 kit-check proves every sidecar merge line, not just three of them`
- Plus the whole `test-hardening` branch these sit on: 5 commits, 296
  lines added.

**Notes**

> (nothing)

**Why:** every converted script is byte-identical before and after. The
work is real and it is why the release is trustworthy, and it is still not
news. Resist the pull to write "improved test coverage": it tells the
reader nothing they can use and it spends a bullet from a budget of six.

### Pair 8: where the closer comes from

**Source**

- `aebf74a Registry 5a device verdict: the chain binds without the wrapper`
- `be0fc8b Appendix B is stale: the docs stop saying ET ignores keeps`
- `5dafa05 Docs tell the truth: the keeps claim, the kepub claim, and two stale pointers`

**Notes**

> *For the curious: Amazon's published guidelines say modern Kindles
> ignore the instructions that hold a page together. Testing on a real
> Kindle shows they don't ignore them at all, and Amazon's own website
> says otherwise too. Screepub's notes have been corrected to match what
> devices actually do.*

**Why:** these three commits changed no output. What they changed is what
we believed. That is the closer's entire job. See section 10.

### Failure example 1: plausible, wrong vocabulary

> - **Keep-together now carries the column spelling.** The EPUB renderer
>   emits `-webkit-column-break-inside: avoid` in its own rule, so kepub
>   and Readium honor the keep, and iBooks no longer drops both spellings
>   when they share a declaration block.

**Diagnosis:** fluent, accurate, and written for us. Nearly every noun is
on the say this, not that table, a format is named as a pipeline stage,
and the bold claim names one of our CSS classes where it should name what
the reader sees. This is the failure mode to watch for, because it reads
as competent.

### Failure example 2: too long

> - **No more orphaned lines.** A printed script never leaves a single
>   line of dialogue or action alone at the top or bottom of a page.
>   Screepub now does the same, using the widows and orphans controls,
>   which modern Kindles have honored since firmware 5.12.3 and which Kobo
>   and tolino also read. There's a new switch for it, on by default. Turn
>   it off if you'd rather fit more on each page. It has no effect on
>   older Kindles, which ignore these controls entirely, or on the MOBI
>   file, which ships no stylesheet at all.

**Diagnosis:** 90 words against a cap of 50, and every added word is
registry material the reader cannot use. Firmware numbers belong in the
registry. The device coverage that genuinely matters here is a caveat, and
0.5.0 correctly put a shorter version of it in Good to know instead.

## 9. Good to know

### Sources

Two, and only two:

1. `verdictsOpenedInRange` from `tools/release-notes.ts`: registry entries
   whose device verdict became pending during THIS range.
2. Standing product constraints a reader keeps hitting, such as Kindles
   refusing EPUB files over USB.

**Not** the full pending list. Entries that were already pending before
this cycle reappear in every release forever and train the reader to skip
the section.

### The four-question filter

For anything from source 1, include it only if all four are yes:

1. Did it ship in THIS release?
2. Is it reachable without the reader opting in? A setting that is off by
   default and that nobody turned on is not a caveat.
3. Would the reader notice if our guess is wrong?
4. Has it not already been disclosed in an earlier release file?

Source 2 answers no to the first question by definition, so it gets a
different and stricter test: **at most one standing constraint, and only
when this release's own content invites the reader to get it wrong.**
0.5.0 talks about page turns across devices, which is exactly when someone
decides to drag a file onto a Kindle, so "Kindles still can't read EPUB
files copied over USB" belongs there. In a release about something else it
would be noise, and repeating it every time is how a section gets skipped.

### The honesty classification

Every caveat is one of three things. Say which, in the caveat itself.

- **Inert if ignored.** The device that does not support it simply does
  nothing differently. Reassure, and say why it is safe: 0.5.0's "it does
  nothing on readers that ignore it, so it can't hurt."
- **Degrades visibly.** Say exactly what they would see, and do NOT
  reassure. A reader who finds the defect after we called it harmless will
  not believe the next release's notes.
- **Invisible either way.** Omit it. It is not a caveat, it is an
  engineering note.

### The marker convention

After each caveat sourced from a registry entry, leave an HTML comment:

```markdown
- The new setting hasn't been tested on a physical device yet. <!-- caveat: registry-17 -->
```

The comment does not render on the GitHub release page. It exists so the
next release can grep the previous file and ask: did that verdict land? If
it did, the caveat is retired and may be worth a line in the new notes. If
it did not, the caveat stands and does NOT get repeated.

`docs/releases/0.5.0.md` predates this convention and carries no markers.
For that one file, read its Good to know section directly.

## 10. The closer

One italic paragraph, no heading, at most 70 words, and **optional**.

Its job is exactly one thing: **this release corrected something we
previously believed or documented.** A verdict that landed against
expectation. A published claim that turned out to be wrong. Our own docs
that were saying something untrue.

If nothing in the range did that, **there is no closer.** Most releases
will not have one.

It is not a parking spot for leftover technical detail that would not fit
in a bullet. If you find yourself moving a sentence down here to save a
bullet's word count, delete the sentence instead.

## 11. When the release earns no notes

If nothing in the range changes what a reader would see in a converted
script, write nothing. Do not produce a maintenance placeholder. Say this,
verbatim:

> Nothing in this range changes what a reader would see in a converted
> script, so I haven't written notes. If you're releasing anyway (a
> rebuild, a signing fix, a dependency bump), tell me the reason in your
> own words and I'll write the note from that.

Then stop. If Sam gives a reason, the notes are written from his words and
nothing else.

## 12. Pre-flight checklist

Run all of it before showing anyone anything.

**Counts**

- [ ] `wc -w docs/releases/<version>.md` is under 350.
- [ ] Lede is one sentence, under 25 words.
- [ ] At most 2 change headings and 6 bullets total across them.
- [ ] No bold claim over 10 words; no explanation over 50.
- [ ] At most 3 caveats under Good to know.
- [ ] Closer, if present, is one paragraph under 70 words.
- [ ] Compare all of the above with the previous release file. Shorter is
      the correct direction.

**Language**

- [ ] `LC_ALL=C grep -n $'\xe2\x80\x94' docs/releases/<version>.md` returns
      nothing. That byte sequence is the em dash, which is banned.
- [ ] No term from the say this, not that table appears.
- [ ] Every format name passes section 7's act-on-it test.
- [ ] No heading is New, Improved, Fixed or Changed on its own.
- [ ] Every bold claim stands alone if the reader reads nothing else.
- [ ] Every bullet about a fix says what the reader used to see.
- [ ] Every new switch gives its default, a reason to change it, and the
      rail's exact label.
- [ ] No real script title, author or character name anywhere. Ever.

**Truth**

- [ ] Every claim traces to a commit or registry entry in this range. No
      claim traces to something that shipped in an earlier release.
- [ ] Anything not verified on hardware is described as unverified,
      wherever it appears.
- [ ] Each caveat passes all four questions and is classified honestly.
- [ ] The previous release file's caveats were checked: retired ones are
      not repeated, standing ones are not repeated either.
- [ ] The closer, if present, corrects a belief. If it does not, cut it.
- [ ] Nothing in the file is confidential, and nothing came from a real
      script.

**Then**

- [ ] Be ready to state the count of commits that earned no bullet, and
      the two or three claims you are least sure of, with the evidence for
      each.
