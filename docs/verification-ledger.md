# Verification ledger

Who has checked what, kept in one place so no page has to infer it from a
green checkmark. Three lists. An item moves up only when somebody does the
thing, and the README, the site (screepub.com) and the release notes say no
more than this page does. `tests/site.test.ts` and
`tests/release-artifacts.test.ts` hold the README and the site to it.

The window is the Tauri app in `desktop/` (*Screepub Desktop* on a Mac). The
older Mac app is the frozen Swift app, still the site's Mac download and the
Homebrew cask.

**Verified on a real machine, by a person**

- **The older Mac app**: installed from its notarized download and used to
  convert scripts and send them to a Kindle, over USB and by email.
- **The window on a Mac, from a release.** The owner's Mac updated the window
  from 0.7.2 to 0.7.3 through its own updater: a bundle that `release.yml`
  built, signed and notarized, downloaded, checked and installed by the
  window itself.
- **The window on a Mac, by hand.** A universal `.dmg` built on the owner's
  Mac was mounted, dragged to `/Applications`, opened past Gatekeeper and
  used to convert two real feature scripts; its `.fountain` matched a fresh
  command-line run byte for byte. The 0.7.3 candidate then passed a full
  hands-on pass ([mac-qa.md](mac-qa.md)): converting, the library folder,
  Settings, the Send page's routes, Apple Books, Send to Kindle on the web, a
  Kindle over USB, and installing the KFX plugin into a scratch Calibre. The
  0.7.4 candidate passed the items that pass rechecked. Each Mac that ran
  these is Apple Silicon, so it is the ARM half of the universal download that
  has run.
- **A Kindle**, firmware 5.19.2, over USB (KFX, AZW3 and MOBI) and by email.
- **Apple Books** on a Mac: the book arrives in the library.
- **The window on Linux, ARM.** `Screepub_0.6.0_arm64.deb` and
  `Screepub-0.6.0-1.aarch64.rpm`, built on an aarch64 Linux machine, hold the
  engine, `LICENSE`, `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`, four icon sizes and a launcher
  entry. The engine runs out of both and converts a fixture, and the window
  runs out of the unpacked `.deb`. Nothing was installed. These are the
  packages an ARM machine makes; the Intel packages a release publishes have
  not been run by a person.

**Verified only by CI, and only as far as CI can reach**

- `ci.yml`, on every push: the engine's test suite and typecheck on Linux,
  the command-line archives built for every target and the Linux one run,
  and a Mac job that builds the older Mac app and runs its own checks.
- `desktop.yml`, on every push: the window compiles on macOS, Windows and
  Linux, each platform's bundles are produced, and the engine inside each one
  runs and converts a fixture without installing anything. No runner has a
  display, so nothing here opens the window.
- `release.yml`, on every tag: the same bundles, built again. Since 0.6.0 it
  has built and signed the Mac window, and since 0.7.0 it has notarized it.
  Every bundle is opened and its engine run before anything is uploaded, and
  the update manifest (`latest.json`, Mac only) is read back from GitHub
  after it is published. For the universal `.dmg`, only the ARM half runs:
  the job prints a notice saying so.
- Weekly: the Homebrew cask and the update manifest still match the newest
  release, and the older Mac app's AZW3 and KEPUB checks still pass against
  Calibre's newest version.

**Verified by nobody**

- Installing the `.deb`, the `.rpm` or the `.exe` on a real machine.
- The window on Windows: no runner has a display and no person has opened it.
- The Windows installer itself, run by a person, and the SmartScreen screen
  the README describes.
- The Intel SLICE of the universal macOS `.dmg`. It is built, checked as a
  container, signed and published, and has never executed.
- The window's launcher entry, opened from a Linux desktop menu.
- Dragging a file onto the window on Linux or Windows. On a Mac it is
  verified: the 0.7.3 pass converted a script dropped on the window.
- The window restarting itself after an update, from 0.7.3 on: written and
  tested in code, not yet recorded by a person.
- Kobo, tolino and reMarkable on real hardware. They are tested against
  injected mounts and a stub tablet.
- Any e-reader connected on Linux or Windows.
