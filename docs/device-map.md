# Device map: every reading surface a screenplay EPUB can land on

Researched 2026-07-30 by a six-cluster parallel sweep (Kindle; Kobo/tolino;
PocketBook/Boox/Android e-ink; note-takers; legacy + Nook; reading apps +
OPDS), cross-referenced against Calibre's device-driver tree
(`github.com/kovidgoyal/calibre`, `src/calibre/devices/`). Market-share
figures are directional, not load-bearing. Spec:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-30-device-map-design.md`.

Companion registry: `docs/formatting-options-log.md` (formatting behaviors).
This doc is the **device and transfer-route registry**: which surfaces exist,
how a file gets there from a Mac, and what each surface does to a screenplay.

---

## 1. Transfer-method taxonomy

Every route a converted script can travel, and what each demands of a Mac app.
"Offline" means: works with no internet and no vendor account.

| # | Method | Offline | Mac-side detection | What the app must do |
|---|--------|---------|--------------------|----------------------|
| T1 | **USB mass storage** | yes | volume signature under `/Volumes` (never VID/PID alone: Linux-gadget chips collide, e.g. `0x0525/0xA4A5` is shared by ~8 brands) | copy file into the device's expected folder; eject matters on devices that index on unplug (Kobo) |
| T2 | **USB MTP** | yes | never mounts; IOKit/libusb enumeration only (e.g. Kindle VID `0x1949` with non-MSC interface) | macOS has no native MTP. Either link libmtp (Calibre does, `devices/mtp/unix`; Swift precedent exists) or hand off to a helper (Amazon Kindle USB File Manager, OpenMTP) |
| T3 | **USB-Ethernet web upload** | yes | tablet is a CDC-ECM/RNDIS gadget; Mac gets `10.11.99.2/29`, device serves HTTP at `10.11.99.1` | reMarkable only. `GET /documents/` then `POST /upload` (multipart, field `file`). The GET is required: upload lands in the last-listed folder |
| T4 | **LAN web upload** | LAN-only (no internet, but needs shared Wi-Fi + app open on device) | probe a known port: Boox `:8085/api/device`, Supernote `:8089/` | POST multipart to the device's endpoint; discovery is /24 scan or user-pasted URL/QR (no mDNS on either) |
| T5 | **Vendor cloud ingest** | no | n/a (browser or vendor app) | Send-to-Kindle web (200 MB) / email (50 MB, approved-sender silent-drop trap) / Mac app; tolino webreader (25 GB); Send-to-PocketBook email; PocketBook Cloud; Kobo Dropbox/GDrive sync (model-gated). App can only open URLs, reveal files, or `open -a` a vendor app |
| T6 | **Local app handoff** | yes | `NSWorkspace` / bundle-id checks | `open -a Books`, `open -a "Send to Kindle"`, AirDrop via `NSSharingService`. The whole Apple-ecosystem story |
| T7 | **Local server pull** (HTTP one-shot + QR; OPDS 1.2) | LAN-only | app runs the server; devices come to it | a plain TCP listener needs NO entitlement or Local Network prompt (Apple TN3179) as long as it skips Bonjour. One OPDS 1.2 Atom feed reaches KOReader on every platform it runs on, plus Moon+, Librera, PocketBook app, Thorium, Yomu |
| T8 | **Folder/SD-card copy** (generic escape hatch) | yes | user picks any mounted volume/folder | Calibre's `folder_device` pattern: copy the file, done. Covers every dead MSC reader, SD sneakernet, and unknown future devices with zero per-brand code |

Rejected/dead routes, for the record: `mailto:` (cannot carry attachments,
the reason in-app email-to-Kindle died); Calibre's wireless "smart device"
protocol (undocumented binary protocol, only real client is KOReader, which
already speaks OPDS); Readarr (archived June 2025); Pocket-to-Kobo (Pocket
shut down July 2025).

## 2. Tier 1: hardware, by ecosystem

### 2.1 Kindle (~80% of global e-reader units)

Three transfer eras, all still in circulation:

- **MSC era (2007 to 2023):** Kindle 1 through Paperwhite 5 (2021), Kindle 11
  (2022), Oasis 3. Mounts as `/Volumes/Kindle`: `documents/` for books,
  `system/` alongside. Still the majority of the installed base (19 years of
  devices vs 5-to-10-year lifespans).
- **MTP era (2023 to now):** Scribe flipped to MTP at firmware 5.16.3; every
  model since Oct 2024 (base 2024, Paperwhite 12, Colorsoft, Scribe 3) is
  MTP-only and **invisible to volume scanning**. Only known libmtp PID:
  `0x1949:0x9981` (Scribe 32 GB); Calibre just matches vendor `0x1949`.
- **2026 lineup:** base Kindle $110, Paperwhite 12 $160/$200, Colorsoft
  $250-280, Scribe 3 family $430-630 (Scribe Colorsoft is the 11" flagship;
  arguably the best Kindle screen for a screenplay). Oasis discontinued.

Formats and the two invariants, stated precisely:

- **No Kindle reads sideloaded EPUB. Ever.** A USB-copied `.epub` is ignored
  entirely (not "unindexed": unread). USB formats: AZW3, MOBI, KFX, PDF, TXT.
  EPUB enters only via Send-to-Kindle, where Amazon converts it server-side
  with zero control over the result.
- **Enhanced Typesetting is a property of the format, not the route.**
  Sideloaded KFX gets ET (hyphenation, ligatures, Page Flip) and indexes;
  AZW3/MOBI never do. KFX cannot travel through Send-to-Kindle at all: it is
  USB-only. This corroborates registry §8b (KFX > AZW3 when the toolchain
  exists).
- Sideloads DO index, asynchronously (up to ~24 h on recent firmware; a book
  that crashes the indexer vanishes silently). Collections exist on-device
  but cannot be safely written over USB (`system/collections.json`, SHA1 of
  device-absolute path). `.apnx` page numbers: MOBI/AZW3 only, never KFX.
- Cover quirk: Amazon's servers delete covers on USB-sent non-Amazon books;
  on Colorsoft and newer this is deliberate.

Rendering (live KDP help pages plus device tests; the 2026.2 guidelines
PDF's Appendix B is stale and self-contradictory, so cite the web pages,
not the PDF): `max-width` ignored by both renderer generations; horizontal
margins in %, vertical in em, body margins 0 (§11.3.5); body `line-height`
unsettable (KFX line height is fixed; KF8 clamps near 1.2). Break and keep
CSS: **KFX honors `page-break-*` and `break-*` including `avoid`, and
`widows`/`orphans` from fw 5.12.3** (Kindle Previewer 3.35 and 3.36 added
them circa 2019; jhowell's device tests plus our own #5a and #8b passes
confirm) — with one hard trap: any `background-color` on html or body makes
the KFX converter synthesize a wrapper block of its own, and every keep in
the book then dies silently (MobileRead t=330798, where jhowell frames it
as keeps working on top-level blocks only). Authored nesting depth is NOT
the trigger — Screepub's keeps sit two divs deep inside `section.scene` and
held on device (registry #8b, 2026-07-29) — so the actionable rule is the
root-background ban, not a flat DOM. KF8/AZW3 honors `always` only; there,
file splits remain the only hard break. The Publisher Font toggle protects
`font-family` only.

Screepub needs: (a) keep the MSC volume path (correct today); (b) something
for MTP Kindles: IOKit detection of VID `0x1949` non-MSC + guided handoff to
Amazon's Kindle USB File Manager (bundled with Send to Kindle for Mac since
Nov 2024, macOS 12+) or OpenMTP, or a libmtp route of our own; (c) keep STK
affordances as the online path.

### 2.2 Kobo (~10% global, ~45% Canada)

- **Lineup:** Clara BW / Clara Colour / Libra Colour (2024 wave, current),
  Elipsa 2E (10.3", the EPUB-native note-taker), Sage discontinued, Libra 2
  residual. No new 2026 hardware as of July; refresh expected H2.
- **Transfer:** T1 USB MSC, volume `/Volumes/KOBOeReader` containing
  `.kobo/`. **The `.kobo/version` file is the master fingerprint**: field
  `[0]` serial, `[2]` firmware, last field's final 3 digits = model id
  (`390` Libra Colour, `391` Clara BW, `393` Clara Colour, `690`/`691`/`693`
  are tolino-branded twins). This matters because modern Kobo and tolino
  **share USB PIDs** (`0x2237:0x4237` covers six devices across both brands).
  Drop files anywhere (subfolders fine); **the library imports on eject**,
  so eject is a required step to surface in UI copy. Old models (pre Glo HD)
  have SD slots; treat as T8.
- **Cloud:** Dropbox/GDrive sync exists but is model-gated and account-bound:
  an export destination, not a device route.
- **Formats:** EPUB (Adobe RMSDK renderer) and KEPUB (Kobo's own renderer,
  `.kepub.epub` double extension). KEPUB buys pagination, stats, Page Flip,
  faster turns; it costs hyphenation and justification quality, which a
  monospace ragged-right screenplay mostly does not need. **Default EPUB,
  offer KEPUB as opt-in** (current app behavior: KEPUB choice on the send
  block). `kepubify` (Go, static binary) is the clean sidecar if we generate
  KEPUB ourselves; Calibre never kepubifies for tolino devices, so KEPUB is
  Kobo-branded only.
- **Rendering (Kobo's epub-spec):** never style bare `div`/`span`/`p` (Kobo
  injects its own during processing): class-qualify every selector. Vertical
  margins in em only at 1-2; horizontal % is fine. Base font-size in px/pt,
  not %. `line-height` on body only, or omit. CSS page-breaks unreliable on
  e-ink: separate XHTML files are the only real page break (the same
  conclusion as Kindle's KF8/AZW3 renderer — NOT its KFX one, which honors
  the break CSS; §2.1 and §6).

### 2.3 tolino (~40% of DACH, tied with Kindle there)

Two generations that behave like different brands:

- **Gen A (Android/RMSDK era: shine 3, vision 4-6, epos, page 2):** plain
  USB MSC, **no database**: write into the `Books/` folder at volume root
  (current app behavior, correct). Windows labels `_TELEKOMTOLINO` /
  `FILE-CD_GADGET`; practical macOS tell is a root `Books/` with no `.kobo/`.
- **Gen B (2024+: shine 5, shine color, vision color):** rebadged Kobo
  hardware running tolino-skinned Kobo firmware 5.x. Mounts like a Kobo
  (`.kobo/` present, import-on-eject); distinguish via `.kobo/version` model
  id `690`/`691`/`693`. **Ship plain EPUB, never KEPUB, to tolino** (Calibre
  hard-codes the same rule).
- tolino webreader (`webreader.mytolino.com`, 25 GB) is the cloud route:
  browser upload only.

### 2.4 PocketBook (strong EU niche; Linux, not Android)

- **Lineup 2026:** Verse (Pro/Color), Era (Color/Lite), InkPad 4 / Color /
  X / One (10.3" + stylus). Older Touch Lux / Touch HD still common.
- **The cheap win of the whole map:** T1 USB MSC ("PC Link" prompt, then a
  plain volume), **EPUB3 is first-class native** (no conversion, best format
  breadth in the industry), and rendering honors publisher CSS. Detection:
  do NOT VID/PID match (unregistered Linux-gadget ids that change with
  PC-Link state). Volume signature: root `system/` directory + `Books/`
  (or `books/`) directory; write into `Books/`. Same shape as our tolino
  path. microSD on most models (T8).
- Cloud: Send-to-PocketBook email (`@pbsync.com`), PocketBook Cloud,
  Dropbox folder sync. All account-bound: export destinations only.
- Rendering: publisher CSS respected (user metrics live in editable configs,
  `system/reader/linespacing.cfg` etc.). Our invariants pass untouched.

### 2.5 Onyx Boox and the Android e-ink long tail (~7% and the only grower)

- **Lineup:** Palma 2/Pro (phone-shaped), Go series, Note Air5 C, Note Max
  (13.3"), Tab series. Android 13-15, NeoReader stock, Google Play on most:
  power users run KOReader/Moon+/Librera instead.
- **Transfer:** USB is **MTP-only** (T2): never mounts, invisible to Finder.
  The interesting route is **BooxDrop over LAN** (T4): unauthenticated HTTP
  on port 8085, `POST /api/storage/upload` (multipart, `file` + optional
  `dir`), default destination `/storage/emulated/0/Books/`, probe/discover
  via `GET /api/device` over the /24 (no mDNS). Dependency-free from Swift
  (URLSession + multipart). Caveats: user must open the BooxDrop app on
  device; cleartext on shared Wi-Fi; not cable-offline. Onyx's cloud
  (push.boox.com / eur.boox.com) is account-bound and its desktop app is
  Windows-only in 2026.
- **Long tail (Bigme, Meebook, Hisense phones, Mudita Kompakt, viwoods,
  Daylight DC-1):** all generic Android -> MTP (T2) or their own cloud apps.
  Rendering depends on whichever reader app the user installs: unknowable.
  Document-only tier; the OPDS/HTTP server route (T7) is what actually
  reaches them, via KOReader or any OPDS-capable reader.
- NeoReader rendering: historically weak CSS fidelity, improving (FW 4.2
  engine rebuild); Reading Themes let users stomp margins/line-height, so
  spacing must degrade gracefully under a hostile line-height.

### 2.6 Note-takers: reMarkable, Supernote

- **reMarkable (category leader, ~790k units/yr):** five current SKUs:
  Paper Pure 10.3" mono $399 (the new volume seller), Paper Pro 11.8" color
  $629, Paper Pro Move 7.3" $449, legacy rM1/rM2. PDF and EPUB only; the
  device converts EPUB into its own page model on ingest (layout bugs are
  re-import territory). EPUB gets user-adjustable typography that PDF never
  does, which is exactly Screepub's bet. 226-229 PPI (below e-reader 300);
  rM2/Pure have no light.
  - **Route (T3, already ours):** `http://10.11.99.1` when the USB web
    interface is on. Three hardening facts the current code does not know:
    1. `POST /upload` lands in the **last-listed folder**, not root: issue
       `GET /documents/` first to pin the destination.
    2. The Mac side can be detected cheaply before any HTTP: an interface
       holding an address in `10.11.99.0/29` means cable present, so a probe
       failure means "web interface off," a distinct, actionable message.
    3. 100 MB upload cap (Paper Pro); the toggle does not reliably survive
       reboot; the server keeps running after unplug (stale-probe trap).
  - **Cloud route:** Connect is $3.99/mo and the free tier syncs only 50
    documents; reMarkable's own guidance beyond that is "use USB." Our
    USB-first bet is validated by the vendor.
- **Supernote (Ratta):** Manta 10.7" ~300 PPI (the best pure reading panel
  in the note-taker class), Nomad 7.8". EPUB first-class-ish (font, size,
  row spacing, margin controls; layout freezes once annotated). USB-C is
  **MTP** (T2, never mounts). The app route is **Browse & Access** (T4):
  device shows `http://<lan-ip>:8089/`, plain multipart upload, no auth
  documented, no mDNS: prompt for the IP shown on-device, cache it.
- Kindle Scribe belongs to §2.1 (best Kindle screen for scripts); Kobo
  Elipsa to §2.2 (the only note-taker where EPUB is unambiguously native).

### 2.7 Nook (alive; fragmenting into MSC vs MTP)

- B&N retired the pre-2014 fleet in 2024-25 (sideloading still works on
  them), discontinued GlowLight 4e; current: GlowLight 4 (2021), GlowLight
  4 Plus (2023), Tablet 9; two new devices promised for 2026.
- **MSC models (2009-2022 + GlowLight 4):** volume labeled `NOOK`. Folder
  rule from Calibre, verbatim: `NOOK/Books` for product id >= 0xD (2021+),
  `NOOK/My Files` for 2013-2019, `my documents` for the 2009 original.
  EPUB native (RMSDK family). Sideload quality is historically buggy
  (disappearing sideloads documented across GlowLights): set expectations
  in UI copy.
- **MTP models (2016 GlowLight Plus, 2023 GlowLight 4 Plus):** invisible to
  Finder; even Calibre still fails on the 4 Plus. Document the Android File
  Transfer/OpenMTP workaround; do not build.

### 2.8 Sony PRS and the legacy fleet (the USB-era ghosts)

- **Sony PRS (dead 2014, yet the largest legacy community: MobileRead Sony
  forum still active within weeks):** pure USB MSC, EPUB-native from the
  2008 PRS-505 firmware onward. Folders: `database/media/books` (PRS-505
  class) or `Sony_Reader/media/books` (PRS-T1/T2/T3). Volume labels "Sony
  Reader Main Memory" / "Storage Card". Caveat: on-device library indexes
  (`media.xml` / `books.db`) mean a bare file drop may not surface in the
  library UI on some firmware; say so rather than write their databases.
- **Bookeen (Diva line still faintly alive in EU):** folder `Books` or
  `eBooks`; RMSDK.
- **Everything else in Calibre's tree** (Trekstor, Hanlin/Astak/BeBook,
  Hanvon, iRiver Story, Ectaco jetBook, iRex, Entourage Edge, Teclast pile,
  Samsung SNE, Aluratek, bq, ~22 more in `misc.py`): dead brands, all plain
  MSC with a per-brand folder name. **Not worth per-brand code; entirely
  covered by the T8 generic folder-copy escape hatch**, which is the actual
  lesson of Calibre's `folder_device` + `user_defined` drivers.
- **RMSDK is one rendering family** (Sony, Nook, Bookeen, iRiver, Netronix
  rebrands, and Kobo's non-KEPUB path): CSS 2.1-era parser, honors
  `margin-left/right` in % and `text-indent`. Our existing CSS invariants
  are already RMSDK-safe; one Kobo-EPUB test target validates the whole
  legacy family.

## 3. Tier 2: reading apps

The fallback surface when hardware is absent or hostile. A Mac app has only
five handoff primitives: `open -a`, AirDrop, watched folders, a local
server, and browser-upload handoffs. Nothing here exposes an ingest API.

| App | EPUB fidelity for a screenplay | Ingest from a Mac | Verdict |
|-----|-------------------------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Apple Books** (macOS/iOS) | WebKit, best mainstream CSS: but the user's Justify setting overrides `text-align` and embedded fonts are ignored **unless the OPF carries `<meta property="ibooks:specified-fonts">true</meta>`** | `open -a Books` (Mac, offline); **AirDrop -> "Copy to Books"** (iPhone, offline, reliable); iCloud Books sync of non-purchased EPUBs is documented-flaky: do not build on it | Green *with* the meta; the one-line OPF change is the single highest-payoff item in this tier |
| **Kindle apps** (iOS/Android/desktop) | KFX conversion, ET asserts its own layout; same invariants as hardware | **No offline route exists, period.** USB sideloads never reach apps; only Send-to-Kindle syncs. `open -a "Send to Kindle"` (drag target; its Mac app also bundles the USB File Manager for MTP Kindles) or the 200 MB web uploader | Amber; be honest in UI that this route transits Amazon's cloud |
| **Google Play Books** | Chrome-derived but "weirdest engine" per MobileRead; post-conversion fidelity unverified | Browser upload only (100 MB/file, 1000 books, no API) | Lowest priority |
| **KOReader** (app + alt firmware on Kobo/Kindle-JB/PocketBook/reMarkable) | crengine; publisher-style switches on by default; embedded fonts honored; **best case in the whole map** | OPDS, calibre-wireless, WebDAV/FTP/SSH, USB | Green; the single highest-value T7 target |
| **Moon+ Reader Pro** (Android) | Overrides CSS by default; "Publisher View" restores it | OPDS, Dropbox, WebDAV | Green if docs say "enable Publisher View" |
| **Librera PRO** (Android) | Preserves embedded fonts, keeps monospace | OPDS, cloud drives (F-Droid build strips both) | Green |
| **ReadEra** (50M+ installs) | Imposes own typography; embedded Courier survives (default font mode "Embedded+Custom") | Local files/open-with only; no OPDS | Amber |
| **Lithium** (Android) | Any user font choice breaks CSS monospace | Local only | Red |
| **Thorium Reader** (desktop, EDRLab) | Readium, publisher styles by default; best a11y on macOS | Local open; OPDS | Green |
| **Yomu** (Mac/iOS) | Faithful; reads EPUB **and** MOBI/AZW3 (both our outputs) | iCloud, AirDrop, OPDS, calibre, browser | Green; sleeper pick for Apple users off Books |
| **calibre viewer** (desktop) | Honors book CSS | Local open | Green; calibre is also the middleman: content server serves OPDS at `/opds`, ingest via `calibredb add`, runs natively on macOS |

**The OPDS/HTTP finding (T7), distilled:** one plain HTTP one-shot download
endpoint with an on-screen QR code reaches every app above including the
OPDS-less ones (phone browser downloads, user taps open-with). Layering an
OPDS 1.2 Atom feed on the same listener adds KOReader on all its platforms
plus Moon+/Librera/PocketBook-app/Thorium/Yomu. Both are LAN-offline. On
macOS a bare TCP listener requires no entitlement and triggers no Local
Network prompt (TN3179) as long as we skip Bonjour and show the URL/QR
instead. What OPDS can never reach: Apple Books, Kindle anything, stock
Kobo/reMarkable firmware, Play Books.

## 5. Gap analysis: Screepub today vs the map

Current support (app code, verified against ScreepubKit):

- **Kindle MSC** via volume signature; AZW3 (ebook-convert), KFX (when the
  Calibre+plugin+Previewer toolchain exists), engine MOBI as fallback.
- **Kobo** via `KOBOeReader` volume, EPUB with KEPUB choice on the send
  block; **tolino** via `Books/` folder copy; **reMarkable** via the USB web
  interface; **Apple Books** handoff; **Send-to-Kindle** export affordances
  (the email route was deliberately rejected: mailto: carries no attachment).

What the map says we are missing, tiered by leverage:

**Now (small, high value):**

1. **reMarkable upload-root bug:** `GET /documents/` before `POST /upload`
   (upload otherwise lands in the tablet's last-browsed folder). Plus
   interface-level detection (`10.11.99.0/29` on any interface = cable
   present, so "web interface off" becomes a distinct message) and a 100 MB
   guard. File: `RemarkableDevice.swift`.
2. **Apple Books justification/fonts — DONE 2026-07-30:** emit
   `<meta property="ibooks:specified-fonts">true</meta>` in the EPUB OPF.
   One engine line; without it Books force-justifies ragged-right screenplay
   text the moment a user has Justify on. Shipped in `src/epub/build.ts`
   (with the `ibooks:` prefix declared on `<package>` so epubcheck stays
   quiet); registry #6b.
3. **PocketBook:** volume signature (root `system/` + `Books/`), copy EPUB3
   into `Books/`. Reuses the tolino code path nearly verbatim; zero
   conversion; the best value-per-line in the map.
4. **Generic "copy to folder/volume" destination (T8):** Calibre's
   `folder_device` lesson. One affordance covers every legacy MSC brand, SD
   sneakernet, and future unknowns; strictly higher leverage than per-brand
   signatures.

**Next (moderate effort, clear demand):**

5. **Nook MSC:** volume `NOOK`, era folder rule (`NOOK/Books` 2021+,
   `NOOK/My Files` 2013-2019), expectation-setting copy about B&N's flaky
   sideload indexing.
6. **Sony PRS:** two folder layouts + the index caveat in UI copy. Largest
   legacy community, pure MSC, perfectly aligned with the offline-first
   ethos.
7. **MTP-era Kindle guidance:** detect VID `0x1949` non-MSC via IOKit and
   show a guided handoff (Amazon Kindle USB File Manager / OpenMTP) instead
   of silence. Every Kindle sold since Oct 2024 is invisible to our volume
   scan today.
8. **AirDrop button** for iPhone -> Apple Books (offline, native,
   `NSSharingService`).
9. **KEPUB generation** via bundled `kepubify` for Kobo-branded devices only
   (never tolino; both suites pin this), opt-in, with the
   hyphenation/justification tradeoff noted.

**Later (bigger bets, decide deliberately):**

10. **Local HTTP one-shot + QR, then OPDS 1.2 on the same listener (T7):**
    the single move that reaches KOReader everywhere, the Android reader
    ecosystem, Thorium/Yomu, and Boox's PushRead, all LAN-offline with no
    entitlement cost if Bonjour stays off. This is the "everything else"
    route.
11. **BooxDrop upload (T4):** URLSession multipart to `:8085`, /24 probe or
    pasted URL. Covers the only growing non-Kindle ecosystem without
    touching MTP.
12. **Supernote Browse & Access (T4):** same shape as BooxDrop at `:8089`,
    user-supplied IP.
13. **libmtp linkage (T2):** the only true USB route for the whole Android
    e-ink world + MTP Kindles/Nooks. One native dependency to notarize;
    decide only if 10-12 prove insufficient.

**Registry corrections to carry into docs/formatting-options-log.md:**

- Kindle invariant, precise form: sideloaded EPUB is unread (not merely
  unindexed). The second half this bullet used to carry — "ET ignores
  `widows`/`orphans`/`page-break-inside`, so scene-break integrity requires
  file splits, not CSS" — was the stale Appendix B talking, and is retired:
  KFX honors the keeps and the split minimums (§2.1, §6, registry #5a and
  #8b). File splits remain the right advice for kepub e-ink and for
  KF8/AZW3, NOT for KFX.
- Kobo: class-qualify every selector (Kobo injects bare `div`/`span`);
  vertical em margins only at 1-2; base font-size in px/pt, never %.
- reMarkable: EPUB is converted on ingest; user typography applies to EPUB
  only; empirically verify whether cue-indent horizontal % survives the
  device's own margin setting (open question flagged by research).

**Verification gaps flagged by the sweep** (worth a hands-on check before
building on them): Gen-B tolino macOS volume label (assumed `KOBOeReader`);
PocketBook native OPDS (probably absent); whether Kindle for Mac accepts
drag-in like the Windows app; PW5/Kindle-11 staying MSC on future firmware;
Amazon's EPUB conversion target (KFX vs AZW3) per title.

## 6. Fragmentation support matrix (researched 2026-07-30)

What each rendering family does with the break, keep and split-minimum
properties: the table to check any fragmentation decision against. §2.1
states the Kindle column in prose; the Screepub-side counterpart is the
registry's break entries (#5, #5a, #8b, #8c, #16, #17). "(tested)" means
measured on device — jhowell's reporting or our own passes; everything
else is a citation or, where marked, an inference.

Two things the cells are too narrow to carry. **Apple Books honors only
the OLD column spelling**, and drops both spellings when they share one
declaration block (BlitzTricks) — which is why our stylesheet emits
`-webkit-column-break-inside` in a rule of its own rather than beside the
modern property. And **kepub's NO is for the modern spelling**: its
renderer paginates with multicol, so the old spelling is the one form
that plausibly reaches it, but that is an inference nobody has tested and
t=346874 records only that kepub ignores break CSS.

| Property | KFX/ET | KF8/AZW3 | MOBI 6 | Kobo epub (RMSDK) | Kobo kepub e-ink | tolino | Apple Books |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `break-inside: avoid` | YES (tested); dies book-wide if html/body carries a `background-color` | NO for text blocks (images only) | NO | NO | NO (modern spelling; old spelling untested) | = Kobo column by generation | via the column spelling only (BlitzTricks) |
| `break-before/after: always` | YES | YES | `<mbp:pagebreak/>` only | YES | NO (split files) | YES (Gen A) | YES |
| `break-before/after: avoid` | YES, fw-dependent (tested) | NO | NO | probably YES (inferred from RMSDK honoring book CSS; untested) | NO | likely YES (RMSDK, untested) | NO (WebKit lacks it) |
| `widows`/`orphans` | YES, reported from fw 5.12.3 | NO | NO | YES (t=328903; reported, not verified here) | unverified (patch-lore says its WebKit reads them) | = RMSDK | likely (WebKit, untested) |
| New XHTML file = page break | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES (the only reliable break) | YES | YES |

Kindle Previewer release notes 3.35 and 3.36; MobileRead t=330798 (avoid is
KFX-only; the `background-color` wrapper trap that kills every keep in the
book), t=328903 (RMSDK widows/orphans), t=346874 (kepub ignores break CSS,
split files instead); kobolabs/epub-spec; BlitzTricks, the Blitz
boilerplate's iBooks notes (Books needs the column spelling, alone in its
own block); clagnut.com/blog/2426 (WebKit lacks `break-after: avoid`). The
2026.2 guidelines PDF's Appendix B contradicts Amazon's own live pages and
lost. Not in that list: the **fw 5.12.3** widows/orphans threshold, which
comes from jhowell's device-test reporting rather than any Amazon artifact
— treat the exact version as approximate; the dated artifacts are Previewer
3.35 and 3.36.
