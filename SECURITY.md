# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue for a security problem.**

Report it privately through GitHub:
[**Report a vulnerability**](https://github.com/ssandweiss/screepub/security/advisories/new).
That opens a draft advisory only you and the maintainer can see.

Please include your operating system and its version (macOS, Windows or
Linux), which app (the Mac app, the window, or the command line), the
Screepub version (the version stamp at the foot of the window, Screepub >
About in the Mac app, or `screepub --version`), and, if a specific file
triggers it, how to build a PDF that reproduces the problem. **Don't attach a
confidential script.** If a real one is the only reproducer, say so and we'll
work out a way to narrow it down without you sending it.

Expect an acknowledgement within a week. Fixes ship in a normal tagged
release, and you'll be credited in the release notes unless you'd rather not
be.

## What's in scope

The interesting attack surface is **the PDF parser**, because that's the one
place Screepub handles a file it didn't create. A screenplay arrives from a
producer, an agency, or a stranger, and Screepub opens it.

- **Malicious PDF leading to code execution, or reading or writing files
  outside the output path.** This is the one that matters most.
- **Malicious PDF making the engine hang or exhaust memory** on a file a
  reasonable person would call small.
- **Anything that causes a script to leave the machine without you asking.**
  Converting makes no network requests. Screepub reaches the network only
  when you ask it to: uploading to a docked reMarkable over USB, opening a
  page in your browser, installing the KFX plugin from Calibre's plugin
  index, and checking for or installing an update if you switched that on.
  The [README](README.md#your-script-stays-on-your-machine) lists each one.
  A way to make it do anything else is a real finding.
- **The update path.** The window installs an update only after checking its
  signature against a key built into the app; the Mac app checks the Apple
  Developer ID signature and the version before it replaces itself. A way to
  get either to install something else is a real finding.
- **Signing and entitlement weaknesses.** In the Mac app, the engine is
  signed with JIT entitlements because Bun needs them
  (`app/screepub-engine.entitlements`). If those are exploitable beyond what
  Bun requires, we want to know.

## What's out of scope

- Bugs in [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com) or Amazon's Kindle Previewer,
  which are optional and which Screepub runs only if you installed them
  yourself. Report those upstream.
- What Amazon does with a document after you send it to your Kindle by email
  or through Send to Kindle. That's between you and Amazon.
- The Windows downloads being unsigned. That is known and stated on the
  download pages.
- Vulnerabilities in a dependency with no path to exploitation through
  Screepub, though if you're unsure whether a path exists, ask.
- A PDF that converts badly, produces garbled output, or crashes on
  malformed-but-harmless input. Those are ordinary bugs; please
  [open an issue](https://github.com/ssandweiss/screepub/issues/new/choose).

## Supported versions

The latest tagged release, only, on macOS, Windows and Linux. Screepub is a
small project maintained by one person; there are no long-term support
branches.
