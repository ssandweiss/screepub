# Roadmap

Screepub converts screenplay PDFs into e-books that hold their shape on an
e-reader, works offline, and runs on macOS, Windows and Linux. This page is
what comes next, roughly in order.

This is a small project maintained by one person, so treat dates as absent
rather than optimistic. Things move up the list when people ask for them:
see [Influencing this list](#influencing-this-list).

## Now

- **Images in the book.** Filmmakers put pictures in scripts: storyboard
  panels, a reference photo, a lookbook page, a designed title card.
  Screepub reads the text around them and drops every one. The work is being
  built on the current code in three parts, each useful on its own:
  recognising that a page holds an image and where it sits, carrying it into
  the e-book at a sensible size, and making a full-page image at the front the
  book's cover, so a script with a designed title page shows up as artwork in
  your library instead of a grey rectangle. Two limits: most e-ink screens
  are greyscale, so a colour image reads as black and white on a Kindle, and
  a script padded with full-page photographs makes a file too large to email
  to a `@kindle.com` address.
- **Sending from the Convert page.** Sending a book is its own Send tab
  today. Folding it into Convert puts "send it to my reader" right beside the
  book you just made.
- **Eject after a USB copy.** After copying a book to a reader, offer to
  eject it, so it can be unplugged safely without a trip to the file manager.
- **A way to report problems without a GitHub account.** Every feedback path
  assumes one today, which excludes most of the people Screepub is built for.
- **Keeping `pdfjs-dist` current.** It parses untrusted PDFs, so it is the
  dependency that matters most.

## Next

Deliberately unwritten. What readers trip over decides this section. If
you're using Screepub, what annoys you is more useful than anything on this
page.

## Later

**A library: seeing the books you have made.** The window writes every
conversion into the library folder and offers no way to look at what is in
there: its tabs are Convert, Read, Settings and Send. A library view would
list your books, reopen one without converting its PDF again, and be the
obvious home for each script's settings.

**Sides: reading one character's script.** Extract only the scenes a given
character appears in, or emphasise their lines throughout. Screepub already
identifies every scene and every character cue while converting. Actors,
directors and anyone running a table read do this by hand today.

**Comparing drafts.** Show what changed between two revisions of a script,
scene by scene, instead of a page-by-page PDF diff that reflows into noise.
Screepub already recognises revision marks and scene boundaries.

**A conversion report.** Page count, scene count, and how many lines each
character speaks, all computed during conversion and then thrown away.
Useful if you read scripts in volume.

**A guide inside the app.** The most useful support writing this project has
is the Send-to-Kindle setup, because Amazon silently discards documents from
an unapproved sender and gives you no error to search for. That text lives in
a Markdown file on GitHub, which is exactly where the person hitting the
problem is not. A short guide shown at the point each question comes up would
reach them.

**A running header that says which scene you're in.** On paper you keep your
place with your thumb and the shape of the page. Reflowed onto a screen both
go away. Screepub already knows every scene boundary, so carrying the current
scene heading in a page header is mostly a formatting question. Sideloaded
Kindles ignore most header styling, and a header costs a line on a six-inch
screen, so it would be a setting, off by default.

**The screenplay typeface, everywhere.** Screepub asks each device for
Courier Prime, the typeface of a printed script, but most devices don't carry
it and substitute their own typewriter font. Putting the font inside the
e-book (its open licence allows exactly this) would make scripts look the
same nearly everywhere. It would be a setting rather than always on: the
four font styles add about half a megabyte, Amazon's Send to Kindle strips
embedded fonts, and reMarkable hasn't been tried with them.

**Converting several scripts at once** in the window. The command line can
already be looped; the window can't.

**Right-click a PDF in your file manager** and send it to your e-reader
without opening Screepub at all.

## Influencing this list

The two most useful things you can send:

**A device report.** Kobo, tolino and reMarkable support is written but has
never run on real hardware, and the Windows and Linux downloads have never
been installed by a person. Five minutes with one of those, either outcome,
is worth more than any feature request.

**What broke.** A script that converted badly tells us more than a script
that converted well. Please don't attach confidential material: a
description of where the text sat on the page is almost always enough, and
`tools/make-fixture.py` shows how to build a small invented script that
reproduces a given shape.
