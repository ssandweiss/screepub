// Pure, and deliberately in the window rather than in src/: nothing but a
// window has a browser to open, and the CLI has no use for a GitHub issue
// URL. Putting it in the engine and transpiling it here — the arrangement
// update-compare.js has — would be ceremony for one consumer.
//
// The window does not OPEN this. app.js does, because app.js is the only
// file that touches Tauri, and opening a URL is now a Tauri call.

/** A pre-filled issue: an instruction, an optional context block seeded by

 *
 *  The footer is the point of the whole thing. A report that arrives without
 *  a version costs a round trip before anyone can even look, and the two
 *  versions are the two facts the person reporting is least likely to know
 *  offhand and least able to get wrong if the app fills them in.
 *
 *  Built with URLSearchParams rather than by hand. Feedback.swift had to
 *  patch a literal "+" to %2B afterwards, because URLComponents leaves it
 *  alone and a query parser then reads it as a space — so "C++" arrived as
 *  "C  ". URLSearchParams encodes it correctly to begin with, which is why
 *  this port does not carry that fix-up across: the bug it fixed does not
 *  exist here. */
