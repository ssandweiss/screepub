// Read: the converted script, keeping its shape, with its scene rail.
//
// The engine produces this document (tokensToPreviewHtml) and its stylesheet
// (src/epub/css.ts). The reader renders exactly those, so a formatting
// decision cannot disagree between this window and the EPUB a reader
// actually gets. Nothing here styles a screenplay: there is no rule below
// for a slugline, a cue or a line of dialogue, and there must never be one.
//
// HOW, and why it is not simpler than this — all four routes were measured
// in a real window before this was written:
//
//   * The window's CSP is `default-src 'self'`, which blocks every inline
//     style, INCLUDING a <style> inside an <iframe srcdoc>: srcdoc frames
//     inherit the parent's policy. Leaving the engine's <style> in place
//     renders an unstyled script with no error anywhere.
//   * CSSOM is not blocked. So the <style> is lifted out of the document
//     and its text is adopted as a constructed stylesheet instead — same
//     bytes, same rules, nothing rewritten.
//   * The sheet must be constructed in the FRAME's realm. A CSSStyleSheet
//     built in this document is rejected when adopted into another.
//   * The asset protocol renders but is cross-origin: the parent cannot
//     script the frame (no place-keeping, no rail) and the frame cannot
//     reach the bundled fonts. Rejected.
//
// The frame is an iframe rather than a div because the engine's stylesheet
// has `html, body` rules, and an iframe is the only container that has an
// html and a body of its own to give them.
//
// The file is in two halves, the way convert.js is. Everything this surface
// DECIDES — what the rail says, where the reader is, what to render when
// there is nothing to read, how the engine's document is taken apart — is a
// pure exported function above the line, tested directly. Below the line is
// drawing, which holds no rule of its own and rides on the live run.
