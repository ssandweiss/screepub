// Turns on a book: one queue per library EPUB, readers and writers, so no
// engine call reads the book while another is rewriting it.
//
// Three pages touch a script's library EPUB. The Settings page's save
// rebuilds it in place (tune.js's reconvert), and converting the same PDF
// again writes it afresh (convert.js): those WRITE it. The Send page builds
// the Kindle file from it, copies it, sends it and checks its date: those
// only READ it, except the engine's own MOBI rung, which rewrites the EPUB in
// place before it writes the .mobi beside it. Unordered, a send could start
// before a moved knob's rebuild landed and ship the book without it, or a
// rebuild could replace the file under a send reading it.
//
// So every such engine call takes its turn here, keyed by the EPUB's path:
//  - Readers run side by side. Save the EPUB pressed while the Kindle file
//    builds in the background (half a minute of Kindle Previewer) starts at
//    once rather than waiting that out.
//  - A writer runs alone: it waits for every reader running to finish, and
//    nothing starts beside it.
//  - Arrival order is kept. A reader that arrives while a writer waits
//    queues behind that writer rather than slipping past it, so a Settings
//    change always lands before a later send reads the book, and a writer is
//    never starved by readers that keep arriving.
//
// One queue PER BOOK, not one for the window: a new script's saves must
// not wait out the old script's KFX build, and an engine call that never
// answers holds up its own book and nothing else.
//
// Two Kindle file exports of one book must not run at once either (both
// would drive Kindle Previewer at the same scratch file), but that is a rule
// about the Kindle FILE, not the book, and send.js keeps it on its own.
//
// Pure: no Tauri, no DOM, nothing but promises, so tests drive it directly.
