 *
 *  'live'      the preview changes the moment this moves.
 *  'book'      the BOOK changes and the preview cannot show it. The preview
 *              is the script itself; a generated title page is not in it.
 *  'reconvert' decided while the PDF is read, written into the script
 *              Screepub keeps, and therefore not recoverable from it. These
 *              are the four knobs src/fountain/serialize.ts consumes.
 *
 *  The temptation with the last group is to hide them. That trades one

 *  conversion, and a reader who cannot find it cannot set it. Saying so is
