// the page server, the demo library, the first-pass pictures, and the
// folders above the library that it had to make (and only those, and only
// if they are empty). Cleanup runs whether the run succeeds, fails or is
// interrupted (the command hands it to its signal handlers), each step on
// its own so one failure cannot skip the rest, and a cleanup failure is
// reported after the error that ended the run, never instead of it.
//
// Nothing is written to the repository until every picture has been taken,
// no engine call was refused or failed, and the page server hit no error,
// so a run that dies half-way leaves the committed pictures exactly as they
// were. The library's marker names the run's pid, so two runs at once
// cannot delete each other's library.
