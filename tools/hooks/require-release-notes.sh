# Claude Code PreToolUse hook body for Bash tool calls.
#
# THIS IS AN ERGONOMICS GUARD, NOT A SECURITY BOUNDARY. It only runs when
# Claude Code is about to execute a Bash command through this hook; a tag
# typed directly into a terminal, created by a different tool, or pushed
# from another machine entirely is never intercepted. The checks that
# actually gate a release live in .github/workflows/ci.yml and the
# `checks` job of release.yml, and those run in CI no matter how the tag
# got there. Forms it knowingly does NOT catch, which CI does: `git -C .
# tag`, double-space spellings, `git update-ref refs/tags/...`,
# `git push --mirror`, and `gh api` calls that create a tag or release
# directly.
#
# Purpose: block creating or pushing a version tag (`git tag`, tag-moving
# `git push` forms, `gh release create`) when docs/releases/<version>.md
# is not committed at HEAD. Exit 2 blocks the pending tool call and shows
# stderr to the model; any other exit (this script always uses 0) lets it
# proceed.
#
# Recovery is guaranteed for the forms this script recognizes: `git tag
# -d`/`--delete`, `git push --delete`/`-d`, and pushing a tag deletion
# (`:refs/tags/...`), checked before anything else that could block. A
# guard that blocks the fix is worse than no guard, because it fires
# exactly when someone is already undoing a mistake. This is a guarantee
# about recognized forms, not literally every string that deletes a tag --
# an unrecognized spelling fails closed like anything else this guard
# cannot resolve (see the version-extraction step below).
#
# When the command was cleanly extracted by jq, matching is done against
# actual shell SEGMENTS of the command, not the whole string and not only
# its first token. A segment boundary is any of `;`, `&`, `|` (which also
# covers `&&` and `||`) or an embedded newline; each segment is then
# stripped of a leading environment-variable assignment (`FOO=bar `) or a
# small set of shell keywords (`do`, `then`, `else`, `elif`, `while`,
# `until`, `if`) before being checked, so `cd /tmp && git tag --list`,
# `GIT_PAGER=cat git tag --list`, and `for x in 1; do git tag --list;
# done` are all recognized as the same read-only listing that
# `git tag --list` alone already was. Whether the command counts as
# COMPOUND at all is still decided by the ORIGINAL whole-string test
# below (a shell metacharacter present AND more than one `git
# tag`/`git push`/`gh release create` substring anywhere in the string),
# specifically because that cruder test also catches an invocation
# hidden inside `$(...)` or backticks that segment-splitting alone would
# never see (segment-splitting does not descend into either). "Compound"
# means BOTH a shell metacharacter is present AND more than one
# `git tag`/`git push`/`gh release create` invocation appears -- a plain
# metacharacter alone (`git tag --list | wc -l`) is not enough to trip
# it. On a compound command, the only exemption available is "every
# invocation present is a recognized recovery form" (e.g. `git tag -d v1
# && git push origin :refs/tags/v1`, the standard two-step undo) --
# outnumbering a real create with deletes elsewhere in the same line does
# not exempt it. On a non-compound command with exactly one real
# (segment-anchored) invocation, that segment is checked against both the
# recovery forms and the read-only tag-listing allowlist (`git tag`,
# `--list`, `-l`, `--contains`, `--points-at`, `--sort`, `--merged`,
# `--no-merged`, `--format`) -- but the listing allowlist is ALSO gated on
# naming no version at all, because no legitimate read-only form does,
# while a real `-a`/`-m` create can have "--list" or "--format" appear
# only incidentally, inside its message.
#
# A command whose tag-invocation-shaped text (e.g. the literal substring
# "git tag") never appears in command position in any top-level segment
# -- `grep -rn "git tag" docs/`, `echo "run git tag to list"` -- is not
# actually touching a tag at all and is waved through immediately,
# UNLESS the command also contains `$(...)` or a backtick, in which case
# a real invocation could be hiding out of segment-splitting's sight and
# this guard deliberately does not rule that out; it falls through to
# the version-extraction step below instead, which scans the raw string
# regardless of shell structure.
#
# When jq could not be used (missing, or the JSON did not parse), `cmd`
# is the raw, unparsed stdin payload, which does not start with `git` --
# it starts with `{`. The segment-anchored checks above would then never
# match, which would make recovery fail in exactly the degraded mode the
# raw fallback exists to serve. So in that mode ONLY, recovery reverts to
# the original bare-substring test instead: never blocking recovery
# outranks the precision segment-matching buys elsewhere.
#
# `git push` is treated as tag-touching both for the explicit bulk forms
# (`--tags`, `--follow-tags`, `refs/tags/`) AND whenever the command also
# names a vX.Y.Z token, because `git push --atomic origin main v0.5.0` --
# pushing a single tag by name, no flag at all -- is the exact command the
# release flow is designed to print.
#
# Version extraction mirrors release.yml's own regex
# (`^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+(-[A-Za-z0-9.]+)?$` against the tag with the
# leading `v` stripped), so a prerelease like v0.5.0-rc1 requires
# docs/releases/0.5.0-rc1.md, not docs/releases/0.5.0.md -- CI would
# reject exactly the tag this hook would otherwise wave through. Every
# vX.Y.Z(-prerelease)? token in the command is checked, not just the
# first, so `git push --tags origin v0.5.0 v99.0.0` blocks regardless of
# which order the tags are listed in.
#
# The pending command arrives as model-generated JSON on stdin, at
# .tool_input.command. That string is ONLY EVER matched against with
# plain substring/regex checks -- it is never eval'd, never passed to
# `bash -c`, and never allowed to undergo command substitution. Doing
# otherwise would let a crafted command execute before this guard, or the
# user's own permission prompt, ever sees it.
