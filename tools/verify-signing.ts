//
// Step 3 of docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-20-swift-to-tauri-handover.md.
// Signing has never executed: those secrets only reach a tagged release
// and no tag has ever built a Tauri app, so everything this repository
// says about the macOS signature is currently read off tauri-bundler's
// source rather than off an artifact. This is the tool that ends that, and
// it runs against a DOWNLOADED release asset, never against a local build,
// because the thing being tested is what CI produced and published.
//
// Why it is not the three commands the plan writes out. The plan's
// shorthand requirement is
//
//   =anchor apple generic and certificate leaf[subject.OU] = "XSRB3D643J"
//
// and that is strictly WEAKER than UpdateInstall.swift's: it drops both
// Developer ID certificate-chain clauses, and for the app it drops the
// bundle identifier. An artifact can satisfy the shorthand and still be
// refused by the installer, which is precisely the gap step 3 exists to
// close. tests/verify-signing.test.ts pins the strings below against the
// Swift that builds them.
//
// It also answers step 4 without anyone installing anything. The two
// releases differ in exactly one variable, the identifier, so "would the
// frozen updater install this?" is a question codesign can be asked
// directly: at v0.6.0 the answer must be NO and at v0.6.1 it must be YES.
// Finding out on a Mac with a working app on it is the expensive way.

// ── notarization ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A SEPARATE axis from everything above, and the reason this section
// exists: v0.6.0 shipped a DMG that passed every check in this file and
// was still wrong. tauri-bundler notarizes the .app (app.rs, right after
// signing it) and the DMG path only SIGNS (dmg/mod.rs, which links
// tauri-apps/tauri#12288 about not self-signing images). Nothing in the
// bundler ever submits the container, so the ticket ends up stapled to
// the app inside an image that carries none.
//
// The frozen updater does not care: dmgRequirement pins the anchor, the
// chain and the team, not notarization, which is exactly why this got
// through. A PERSON cares, because a browser download carries the
// quarantine attribute and Gatekeeper assesses the image when they
// double-click it. Measured on the published v0.6.0 artifacts:
//
//   Screepub-macOS.dmg                     accepted, Notarized Developer ID
//   Screepub-Desktop-macOS-universal.dmg   rejected, Unnotarized Developer ID
//   the .app inside the latter              accepted, Notarized Developer ID
//
// So this is a regression against the DMG that ships today, and
// app/release.sh is the reference: sign, notarize, staple, validate.
