// Which Rust target triple corresponds to each Bun compile target, and what
// the sidecar file must therefore be called.
//
// This is the one fact in piece C that a mistake hides rather than reveals.
// Tauri resolves a bundled external binary by name, with the Rust triple as
// a filename suffix; the rule was VERIFIED by running a real build and a
// real app on this machine (see desktop/README.md, "How Tauri finds the
// engine"), not read out of documentation. A wrong triple here compiles
// cleanly, bundles cleanly, and fails at runtime on someone else's computer.
//
// Two tables exist on purpose. tools/build-cli.ts's TARGETS is the RELEASE
// matrix and holds no darwin row, because a macOS artifact must come signed
// and notarized from app/release.sh. A sidecar is not a release artifact:
// it is an input to a build, so darwin belongs here. The same reasoning
// covers the two Linux musl rows below: nobody ships a musl release
// artifact, but a contributor's dev machine can be a musl host, so the
// sidecar table carries them and the release table does not.
// tests/sidecar-targets.test.ts pins that the release table is a subset of
// this one.

 *  gnu/musl axis, so hostBunTarget alone cannot tell a musl host from a
 *  glibc one. Fixed here by asking the toolchain instead:
 *
 *   1. The RUST TRIPLE — the part Tauri uses to resolve the sidecar's
 *      filename — is asked of rustc, not read off the pinned
 *      SIDECAR_TARGETS row for the platform/arch guess.
 *   2. The BUN TARGET actually compiled — bun-linux-x64 vs.
 *      -x64-musl — is swapped to the musl sibling when that same rustc
 *      answer says musl, via muslSiblingOf.
 *
 *  Getting only #1 right and not #2 was fix round 1's gap: the sidecar
 *  would be NAMED correctly for a musl host but built from the pinned
 *  glibc row, which has no musl row to fall back to — so the build failed
 *  outright instead of shipping a binary that silently couldn't run.
 *  Getting neither right is the original failure Task 1 found: cargo
 *  build succeeds, the sidecar bundles under the wrong name, and the app
 *  fails at runtime with a bare "No such file or directory" naming no file
 *  at all.
 *
 *  Cross-compiled targets (--target / --all in build-sidecar.ts) keep the
 *  pinned table exactly, musl rows included: you cannot ask rustc about a
 *  triple it is not installed for, so there --target=bun-linux-x64-musl
