/** Convert an EPUB to KEPUB for Kobo's own renderer (Calibre 7.1+ emits

 * selects its OUTPUT FORMAT from the output file's extension, so converting
 * straight to `<stem>.kepub.epub` makes it see ".epub" and emit a plain
 * EPUB with no koboSpan markup at all — the one thing that makes this a
 * KEPUB. Convert to `<stem>.kepub` first, then rename to the double
 * extension the Kobo renderer selects on.
 *
 * DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE from EbookConvert.swift (2026-09-12): the Swift
 * passes the guards to toAzw3 but not here, and this port passes them to
 * both. That difference was carried across faithfully at first, on the
 * rule that device behavior nobody can re-verify gets preserved rather
 * than "fixed" — but the rule does not apply, because the guards are not
 * device behavior. `--disable-remove-fake-margins` governs how Calibre
 * READS the EPUB: the heuristic strips per-block side margins during
 * input processing, before the output format is chosen, and the Swift's
 * own note records it deleting them "regardless of unit". A screenplay's
 * dialogue column is exactly what it mistakes for publisher page margins,
 * so KEPUB is affected for the same reason AZW3 was — device-verified
 * 2026-07-29 on the AZW3 path. The Swift omission reads as a plain bug.
 *
 * Consequence: TypeScript and Swift now disagree here until the Swift app
 * retires (cross-platform piece F). Nothing consumes this function yet,
 * so no user sees either behavior. Still unconfirmed on real hardware —
 * no Kobo has ever been connected to this project — so this stays on the
 * device-checklist for the first Kobo pass. */
