// ── installing jhowell's plugin, without shipping a copy of it ───────

// The header above says installation was deferred because it "needs the
// vendored 485 KB zip". That premise is gone: there is no zip. Calibre's
// own plugin index is the upstream and Calibre's own add_plugin is the
// installer, so the user gets whatever version is current on the day they
// ask rather than whatever we last vendored. The Swift app's copy was
// pinned at 2.12.0 and was a FORK; the index currently offers 2.20.1.
//
// Not shipping it also drops a GPL-3 redistribution obligation and the
// THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES entries that went with it.
//
// This runs inside Calibre's Python (`calibre-debug -c`) because everything
// it needs lives there: bz2 for the index, Calibre's cert-pinned fetch for
// the index itself, and add_plugin. Our side is one spawn and one JSON line.
//
// Integrity: the index declares the zip's exact byte size and the download
// is refused unless it matches. That is weaker than a signature, which does
// not exist for this plugin, and it is the honest limit of what can be
// checked. The index fetch uses Calibre's pinned CA; the zip download
// cannot, because the mirror's cert does not validate under that pinning.
//
// NEVER call this on its own initiative. It writes to the user's Calibre
// and fetches third-party code over the network, so it belongs behind an
// explicit request. It is also the one thing in this module that needs a
// network at all (registry: everything else works offline).
