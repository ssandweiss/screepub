// Is this release newer than the build that is running?

// A port of `UpdateCheck.swift`'s version comparison, and the ENGINE half
// of the updater. The Tauri plugin does transport: network, signature,
// download, swap. This decides, because deciding is what the governing
// ADR says belongs on this side of the line.
//
// The plugin answers the same question with semver, and semver is wrong
// in one constant way. A build past a tag describes itself as
// `0.6.0-1-g965cb10`, and semver reads any hyphen suffix as a
// PRE-release, so it calls that build older than `0.6.0` and offers
// `0.6.0` as an upgrade. It is not older; it is the tag plus one commit.
// Accepting the offer installs a downgrade, and it would do so on every
// developer machine, every time. UpdateCheck.swift's own comment:
//
//   treating it as a pre-release would install a downgrade on every
//   post-tag dev build
//
// So the window asks the plugin what it found and then asks this whether
// to believe it. See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-21-updater-design.md.
//
// No network, no filesystem, no clock. Pure, so the whole of it is
// ordinary `bun test` coverage, which is the point: this replaces 17 of
// kit-check's checks that exist nowhere else.
