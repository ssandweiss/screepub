// The format says `[[...]]` is invisible in output. Before registry #18 we
// never emitted one and never stripped one either, so a hand-written note
// rendered as literal text — a spec violation nobody had hit. Stamping fmt
// notes into the .fountain makes stripping load-bearing, so it lives here,
// beside slug.ts, as the one copy both renderers import (the registry #5b
// precedent) rather than two regexes that drift.
